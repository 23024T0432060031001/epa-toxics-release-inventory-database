The lead compounds are used in certain colors of screenprint ink only and are part of the mixture that is applied to glass products. Painted product is shipped out to customers. Screens containing paint mixtures are cleaned by washing down screens with solvent and the solvent containing lead compound paint residue is transported offsite by an agent, Giant Resource Recovery.  Actual lead compound disposed as 2005 waste was calculated as follows: 8050 total pounds of lead compound based screenprint paint was used in 2005.  (Per the vendor Sara Reportable Report the paint purchased weighed 8050 pounds which contained .4043% lead compound.) The actual lead compound paint weight reported was 3148.22#. The paint was used over 30 set ups. Each set up when complete nets one cup of left over paint residue. The left over paint weighs .22# per cup which contains .4043% lead compound. One gallon of solvent was used  in screen clean up for each of the 30 set ups. 30 gal. of solvent containing lead compound paint residue weighed 423# (30 set ups x 14.1 lbs./gal.= 423 lbs.) If one cup of left over paint weighs .22# and .4043% of the paint is lead compound then that must be cleaned from the screen with one gallon of solvent. (.22# per cup of paint x 30 set ups = 6.6# of paint containing .4043% lead compounds or 2.67# of straight lead compound was transported offsite in 423# of solvent.  This data comes from 2005.

The contact agent is David Nagy: Phone 413-452-2000  These zinc compounds (N982) are part of the mixture, which is continuously maintained in proper ratios with other components. This is accomplished by removal of interfering ferric iron using small amounts of nitrite to form insoluble ferrous phosphate sludge.  Heatbath analyses supernatant monthly samples to guide formulation adjustments by adding a replenishing mixture containing zinc phosphate, zinc nitrate, phosphoric and nitric acids to restore the working formulation.   The basic chemistry is as follows: nitric acid oxidizes the steel to chemically bind zinc phosphate to its surface. The bound phosphate acts as an elastic coating having lubricating and rust inhibiting properties, which survive die forming and other abrasive activities.

Simultaneously RY2005 shows increases in treatment of methanol.    Release reductions are primarily due to the use of newer, updated and more appropriate emission factors published by the National Council for Air and Stream Improvement, Inc. (NCASI) for the pulp and paper industry.  These emission factors were published in February 2006.  Examples of reduction include air emissions from various equipment sources.  Most of these were reduced.  Furthermore, where NCASI indicated multiple data source tests, the median data was deemed most appropriate.  Previously, some emission factors were based on maximum data points.    The increase in treatment is due primarily due to the percentage of water flow increases when comparing RY2004 to RY2005.  Boise has a relatively unique wastewater treatment system.  The system is an UNOX system that is covered.  Monitoring data has not detected VOC emissions or methanol in the effluent water stream.  Hence the system treatment efficiency is considered nearly 100% effective.  Additional source reductions would not have had significant effects on release reductions.  Newer, updated, and more appropriate emission factors account for the reductions in releases.   RY 2006 will show the effects of methanol reductions due to the HVLC system installed during 2005 to collect off gases from several equipment process points.  It is estimated methanol emissions will be reduced over 90% when the HVLC system is operating and the off-gasses are subsquently incinerated in an industrial furnace.

This process, known in wave soldering as a "pot swap" entailed shipment for recycling of all cooled solder contained in two wave solder machines, and shipment of all remaining dross associated with the old solder. This effort therefore accounts for approximately one third of the total amount identified under section 8.5 (offsite recycling for metals recovery).    The RoHS regulations effective date of 7/1/06 also affects Crown's projected numbers in Column C of Section 8 for the next RY, 2006.  As of 5/22/06, Crown ceased lead solder usage in all but a portion of product intended for domestic shipment.

Deemed as the "lead-free" initiative our lead-free products us a less toxic substitute for lead is solder paste and solder spheres.  The reduction of lead waste will be realized through increased customer orders for "lead-free" product as bans on lead containing materials are enforced in the European Union Countries and as suppliers of EU Electronics are forced to remove lead from their own product offerings.  Leaded products will continue to be offered because some customer specifications still require that leaded materials be used, however we project that orders of lead-free products will eventually overtake orders for product that contain lead.

It is suspected that the n-hexane default concentration value is too high and not representative of our fuels.  PREPA attempted to contact EPA about this and to research their sources but no response was provided.  The n-hexane concentration in the fuel is expected to decrease from the default value to approximately 0.01 weight percent.  An internet and literature search also confirms PREPA's suspicions.  Consequently, releases next year and in subsequent years are expected to diminish by the same order of magnitude.  Applicable Source Reduction Codes are:  W19, W22, W29, W49.  Compounding this void of facility specific data, last year PREPA double counted fuel consumption for this chemical release estimate and emission factor results were higher than expected.

Gases are cooled in a series of tubes.  Then fabric filter baghouses are used to control metals particulate.  Wet Scrubbers are then used to control sulfur dioxide (SO2).  Emission Control Sludge (ECS) is generated from the scrubbing of SO2 with lime (CAOH) slurry, resulting in a gypsum (CASO4) sludge with some metals.  We replaced all the filter bags in our baghouses cell by cell with a new bag design which has three rings throughout the length of the bags.  The rings prevent the bags from collapsing, thereby reducing the chances of clogging and eventually tearring.  This has led to increased baghouse efficiencies and a reduction of lead escaping the baghouses into the scrubbing system and being sent offsite in our ECS wastestream from 338,698 lbs in 2004 to 30,655 lbs. in 2005.

Manufacturing changes were triggered by the new restrictions of the European Union Restriction of Hazardous Substances (RoHS).  Benchmark continues to contribute to the New England Lead-free Electronics Consortium composed of both electronic manufactures and the University of Massachusetts to investigate potential issues with Lead free electronic design.   Initial stages of the reduction program are focusing on identifying all lead containing components/parts and replacing them with equivalent "lead free" materials. Reduction of Lead used in the soldering process and replacement materials are currently being evaluated in various phototype models in preparation for full production.  Actual lead reduction measures will be based upon 2004 baseline amounts, lead reduction in our manufacturing process will be directly proportional to the increase demand by customers to be in compliance with the RoHS standards.

Spillage and leakage is kept to an absolute minimum, and any residue on the floor is quickly cleaned up so that it does not end up in the drain or on land at the plant.  Small amounts may end up in the solid waste that is collected by our trash vendor, and small amounts may inadvertantly get into the sewer from hand-washing, or from wiping down equipment or mopping floors, but these would be very small amounts.

In 1997, Johnson Controls voluntarily performed emission testing to better define process (stack) air emissions.  This testing was witnessed by the state regulatory agency (MDNR) and used to develop emission factors for air emission reporting.  The test results and calculated emission factors were reviewed and approved by MDNR.  DEOA emissions from foam production are expected to be low, as it is a reactant in the process and is consumed.  This was supported by the results of the emission testing study - all test results were BELOW the analytical detection level (i.e. DEOA emissions were not detected).  Consequently, the emission factor developed for DEOA was based on the analytical detection level.  This is a very conservative approach and results in over reporting of DEOA air emissions.

There are plans to streamline these processes even more in 2006, including changing from using wave solder technology to selective soldering technology.
