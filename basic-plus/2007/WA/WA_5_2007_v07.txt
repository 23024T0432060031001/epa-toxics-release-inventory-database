The 2006 Form R report showed the total weight of the lead-containing waste shipped to those facilities, rather than just the actual lead content of those wastes.  The solder used at SEL is composed of 37% lead and 63% tin, so the amount of lead shipped offsite in solder dross for recycling should have been reported as 37% of the total weight of the solder dross, not the entire amount.  Similarly, only the actual lead contained in the solder flux and lead-contaminated wipes, rags, and other materials shipped offsite for treatment or disposal should have been reported on the 2006 Form R report.  All Form R reports for lead in the future from SEL will only show the actual lead content in the offsite waste shipments.

IN 2006, BOTH LEAD AND LEAD COMPOUNDS EXCEEDED THE PBT THRESHOLD OF 100 POUNDS, AND A COMBINED REPORT FOR LEAD COMPOUNDS WAS SUBMITTED, PER EPA GUIDANCE.  IN 2007, LEAD EXCEEDED THE THRESHOLD, BUT LEAD COMPOUNDS DID NOT.  DISPOSAL OF 14,900 POUNDS OF LEAD IN LDR-COMPLIANT WASTE IN TRENCHES 31 AND 34 (REPORTED IN SECTION 8.1A), DISPOSAL OF 2,130,000 POUNDS OF LEAD IN LDR-COMPLIANT REMEDIATION WASTE IN THE CERCLA ERDF TRENCH (REPORTED IN SECTION 8.8), DISPOSAL OF 0.3 POUNDS OF LEAD IN A TREATED EFFLUENT DISPOSAL FACILITY (PERMIT CONCENTRATIONS WERE NOT EXCEEDED, INCLUDED IN 8.1B), TRANSFER OF 41443.5 POUNDS OF LEAD TO OFFSITE TSD FACILITIES FOR TREATMENT AND/OR DISPOSAL (REPORTED IN SECTION 8.1D) AND 64,232.6 POUNDS OF LEAD SENT OFFSITE FOR RECLAMATION (REPORTED IN SECTION 8.5), ALL SEEM TO BE HUGE QUANTITIES OF LEAD RELEASED TO THE ENVIRONMENT.  HOWEVER, ALL OF THIS LEAD WAS PROPERLY DISPOSED OF IN PERMITTED FACILITIES THAT WERE IN FULL COMPLIANCE WITH LDR REQUIREMENTS FOR LEAD.  THE ONLY SIGNIFICANT RELEASE OF LEAD TO THE ENVIRONMENT THAT WAS NOT INTO A PERMITTED FACILITY WAS THE 9,136 POUNDS OF LEAD FROM AMMUNITION FIRED AT THE HANFORD PATROL FIRING RANGE (REPORTED IN SECTION 8.1B).  ALTHOUGH THE 2,130,000 POUNDS OF LEAD FROM CERCLA REMEDIATION WASTE ARE SHOWN AS A "RELEASE TO THE ENVIRONMENT" REPORTED IN SECTION 8.8, THE ACTUAL SITUATION IS THAT THIS QUANTITY OF LEAD WAS CLEANED UP FROM THE ENVIRONMENT, AND PLACED INTO A PERMANENT COMPLIANT DISPOSAL FACILITY.

THE THRESHOLD WAS EXCEEDED AGAIN IN 2007, AND IS EXPECTED TO DO SO AGAIN IN 2008 AND 2009.  THE ACTIVITY INDEX WAS REPORTED BASED ON COMPARISON OF CRAFT HOURS EXPENDED IN 2007 COMPARED TO 2006, ALTHOUGH IT COULD HAVE BEEN MARKED NA.  THERE WAS AN UNQUANTIFIED RELEASE OF PROPYLENE WHEN THE UNDERGROUND DISTRIBUTION SYSTEM FOR PROPANE FAILED; DISCOVERY OCCURED ON 11/15/07.  THE ODORIZED PROPANE WAS PROMPTLY DISCOVERED AND THE SYSTEM WAS SHUT DOWN.  THE LEAK WAS DOWNSTREAM OF ANY METERING DEVICES; HOWEVER, PROPANE USAGE AT THE TIME OF THE EVENT WAS CONSISTENT WITH PROPANE USAGE PRIOR TO THE EVENT.  IT IS BELIEVED THAT VERY LITTLE OF THE PROPANE (CONTAINING APPROXIMATELY 5% PROPYLENE) WAS ACTUALLY LOST FROM THE 2" LOW PRESSURE LINE PRIOR TO DISCOVERY.  IF THE EVENT COULD HAVE BEEN QUANTIFIED, IT WOULD HAVE BEEN REPORTED IN SECTION 8.8.   THE TOTAL FUGITIVE EMISSIONS OF PROPYLENE REPORTED AS A RANGE OF 10 TO 499 POUNDS IN SECTION 5.1 DO NOT INCULDE THIS UNQUANTIFIED RELEASE; HOWEVER, IT IS BELIEVED THAT THE TOTAL FUGITIVE RELEASES OF PROPYLENE WOULD STILL FALL WITHIN THE REPORTED RANGE, EVEN IF THE EVENT HAD BEEN QUANTIFIED AND INCLUDED.  THERE IS NO CERCLA RQ FOR PROPYLENE, SO THIS WAS NOT A REPORTABLE EVENT.	YES	DALE_E_JACKSON@RL.GOV			NO
