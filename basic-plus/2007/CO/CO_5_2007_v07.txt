The new media now allows the recycle of old billboard media versus the former landfilling of the waste material. Circle Graphics, Inc. has been recognized by award from the trade association.  Circle Graphics, Inc. is proceeding with a program to assess the substitution of UV curable inks for the current N230 based inks. UV curable inks contain no N230 and only minimal amounts of non-TAP VOC. The company has purchased 4 new printers that utilize UV curable inks. These printers are in production; and work continues in assessing further refinements in the inks used to expand the use of UV curable inks.  The capture effeciency of the vent hoods over the printers was increased by modifying the hood design. The increase in capture efficiency resulted in a very high percentage of all fugitive emissions being routed to the RTO, and thus reduced ambient air emissions.
