BECAUSE THERE IS A SIGNIFICANT TIME DELAY IN REPLACING ALL LEAD SOLDER PRINTED CIRCUIT BOARDS THAT MAY NEED REPAIR OR REPLACEMENT, ZEBRA ESTIMATES THAT THE ENTIRE LEAD SOLDERING PROCESS WILL BE ELIMINATED BY NO LATER THAN 2015, WHEN THE LAST OF THE LEAD SOLDERED PRINTED BOARDS WILL NO LONGER NEED TO BE REPAIRED OR REPLACED.
