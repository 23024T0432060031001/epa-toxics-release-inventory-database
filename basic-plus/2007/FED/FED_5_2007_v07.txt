The most significant aspect of base operations contributing to the exceedance of this TRI threshold is the use of lead ammunition at the Combat Arms Training and Maintenance (CATM) Range.  Accordingly, the Hazardous Materials Risk Management Team is pursuing the option of so-called "green ammunition" - lead-free bullets made of a tungsten-tin composite - for use on the CATM range.  This type of ammunition is acceptable for training purposes and would substantively reduce the amount of lead otherwise used on the installation, lessen the risk of personnel exposure to lead fumes and dust, and mitigate the potential for lead contamination of the soil and runoff at the CATM Range. Given the time required to procure "green ammunition" through the Department of Defense distribution system, Vandenberg AFB does not anticipate significantly increasing its allocation until calendar year 2009.  Accordingly, starting with reporting year 2009, Vandenberg AFB may expect to realize a 25 percent per year reduction in the amount of lead otherwise used on the installation.  In the interim, Vandenberg AFB is continuing to explore the advisability of using bullet traps to mitigate the adverse environmental impact of lead ammunition.
