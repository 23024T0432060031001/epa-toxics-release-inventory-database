In 2005, the company began to offer customers several alternatives to lead-based solder, such as an Electroless Nickel Immersion Gold process.  As a result, total lead purchases are projected to decrease from 1900 pounds in 2005 to 500 pounds in 2009.   In Section 8. of this report, the values listed in Column C are assumed to be 29% less than the values listed in columns B.  This is based on the assumption of lead purchases decreasing from 1400 pounds in 2007 to 1000 pounds in 2008.  The values listed in column D are assumed to be 50% less than the values in column C.  This is based on the assumption of lead purchases decreasing from 1000 pounds in 2008 to 500 pounds in 2009.  Therefore, with the exception of 2007, source reduction for lead has been signifcant since 2005, and is expected to continue in 2009.	NO	BCAPAR@METROCIRCUITS.COM			YES

THIS LEAVES VERY LITTLE ROOM FOR CHANGES TO PROCEDURES AND PROCESSING MATERIALS. FOR THESE REASONS, THE NATURE OF RIPAK'S ATTEMPTS TO REDUCE THE AMOUNT OF WASTE GENERATED ARE MORE PROCEDURAL IN NATURE. FOR EXAMPLE, IN ORDER TO PROCESS LARGE PARTS, MANY OF THE TANKS NEED TO BE QUITE LARGE TO ACCOMMODATE THE LARGEST PART TO BE PROCESSED. WASTE GENERATION IS MINIMIZED BY ARRANGING PRODUCTION SCHEDULES TO PUT THE LARGEST QUANTITY OF WORK IN A GIVEN RUN, BY USING SEVERAL SMALLER RINSES INSTEAD OF ONLY ONE LARGE RINSE.
