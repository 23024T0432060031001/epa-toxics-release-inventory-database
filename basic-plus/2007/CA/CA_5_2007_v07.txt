The most significant aspect of base operations contributing to the exceedance of this TRI threshold is the use of lead ammunition at the Combat Arms Training and Maintenance (CATM) Range.  Accordingly, the Hazardous Materials Risk Management Team is pursuing the option of so-called "green ammunition" - lead-free bullets made of a tungsten-tin composite - for use on the CATM range.  This type of ammunition is acceptable for training purposes and would substantively reduce the amount of lead otherwise used on the installation, lessen the risk of personnel exposure to lead fumes and dust, and mitigate the potential for lead contamination of the soil and runoff at the CATM Range. Given the time required to procure "green ammunition" through the Department of Defense distribution system, Vandenberg AFB does not anticipate significantly increasing its allocation until calendar year 2009.  Accordingly, starting with reporting year 2009, Vandenberg AFB may expect to realize a 25 percent per year reduction in the amount of lead otherwise used on the installation.  In the interim, Vandenberg AFB is continuing to explore the advisability of using bullet traps to mitigate the adverse environmental impact of lead ammunition.

THIS SUBSTITUTION HAS RESULTED IN A 57% REDUCTION IN WEIGHT PER LINEAR FOOT OF RDC SCRAP GENERATED.   DURING THE REPORTING PERIOD, FROM JANUARY 1, 1999 THROUGH DECEMBER 31, 2002 PSEMC GENERATED 9,525 FT. OR 59 LBS. OF RDC SCRAP.  THE SUBSTITUTION OF TIN FOR LEAD IN THIS INSTANCE RESULTED IN A NET REDUCTION OF 81 LBS.    FROM JANUARY 1, 1995 THROUGH DECEMBER 31, 2002 PSEMC GENERATED 163,393 FT. OR 1019 LBS. OF RDC TIN SCRAP.  THE SUBSTITUTION OF TIN FOR LEAD SINCE INCEPTION RESULTED IN A NET REDUCTION OF 1351 LBS.       SR-2 IT WAS DISCOVERED THAT THE TIN TUBES BEING SUPPLIED TO PSEMC HAD STAINLESS STEEL IMPURITIES.  THESE IMPURITIES WOULD LITERALLY SURFACE DURING THE PROCESSING OF THE PRODUCT.  THE IMPURITIES WERE DEEMED AS THE ROOT CAUSE FOR THE TUBE BREAKAGE PSEMC HAD EXPERIENCED DURING PROCESSING WHICH RESULTED IN ADDITIONAL SCRAP GENERATION.    THE SUPPLIER CORRECTED THE PROBLEM AS REQUESTED BY FILTERING OUT THE STAINLESS IMPURITIES FROM THE TIN IN THE MOLTEN STATE WITH A CERAMIC FILTER. ALTHOUGH PSEMC KNOWS THIS WAS AN EFFECTIVE SOURCE REDUCTION, VARIABILITY IN THE PRODUCTION PROCESS MAKE IT IMPOSSIBLE TO QUANTIFY THE REDUCTION.   SR-3 PSEMC IMPLEMENTED A PROCEDURAL TUBE LOADING MODIFICATION.  THE CHANGE INVOLVED INCREASING THE LOAD TIME BY 15-30 MINUTES PER TUBE.  THIS ENSURES THAT THE UPPER END OF THE TUBE IS LOADED WITH THE PROPER AMOUNT OF POWDER TO MEET AN EXPECTED MASS RATIO OF METAL TO POWDER.     THESE CHANGES HAVE BEEN THE MOST SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT IN OUR EFFORTS TO REDUCE SCRAP AT THE FRONT END OF THE PROCESS.  AS AN EXAMPLE, FROM 1996-1997, PSEMC WAS USING 2,250 FEET PER TUBE AS ITS PRODUCTION AVERAGE YIELD.  AFTER IMPLEMENTING THESE IMPROVEMENTS, PSEMC IS NOW EXPERIENCING AN AVERAGE YIELD OF NEARLY 2,600 FEET PER TUBE. THIS SAVINGS TRANSLATES TO A SCRAP REDUCTION THAT HAS BEEN ESTIMATED AS FOLLOWS (1999): (671 TUBES/YEAR)(2,600 FEET/TUBE-2,250 FEET/TUBE) = 234,850 FEET PER YEAR (1,465 LBS)   THE TOTAL SOURCE REDUCTION ACHIEVED AS A RESULT OF IMPLEMENTATION OF THESE SR MEASURES SINCE INCEPTION, JANUARY 1, 1998 THROUGH DECEMBER 31, 2002 IS AS FOLLOWS (3303 TUBES/YEAR)(2,600 FEET/TUBE-2,250 FEET/TUBE) = 1,156,050 FEET PER YEAR (7,213 LBS)	NO	CMARTIN@PSEMC.COM			YES

The nuts are now heated to a higher temperature before they are loaded into the sterilization chamber.  The higher temperature causes the nuts to absorb the PPO better and release it more slowly.  After the nuts are removed from the sterilization chambers the PPO continues to off-gas in a post-processing area for several days.  Therefore, while the overall PPO usage in 2007 was less than the PPO usage in 2006, the fugitive emissions (Part II, Section 5.1) increased due to a change in processing method.
