THE LEAD WE CURRENTLY USE IS BY WAY OF OUR HOT-AIR SOLDER LEVEL (HASL), WHICH APPLIES A LAYER OF TIN-LEAD SOLDER TO CIRCUIT BOARDS.   WE ALSO REDUCED THIS FORM OF LEAD USAGE SEVERAL YEARS AGO THROUGH AN UPGRADE IN OUR MAINTENANCE STAFF.  OUR FORMER PRACTICE WAS TO REPLACE THE APPROXIMATELY 800 LBS OF 63-37 [63% TIN-37% LEAD] SOLDER IN OUR HASL WHENVER THE COPPER CONTENT REACHED 0.3%.  THIS WOULD OCCUR EVERY FEW MONTHS.  NOW, WE MAINTAIN OUR HASL BY DROSSING THE SOLDER PERIODICALLY.   THE KNOWLEDGE OF THIS PROCESS BY OUR CURRENT MAINTENANCE STAFF ENABLES US TO REPLENISH THE SOLDER WE USE RATHER THAN REPLACE THE ENTIRE 800 LBS, WHICH IS A SUBSTANTIAL REDUCTION.         OUR PRESENT SOLDER USAGE, AND THEREFORE OUR LEAD USAGE HAS PROBABLY REACHED THE BARE MINIMUM REQUIRED FOR OUR CIRCUIT BOARD MANUFACTURING PROCESS.	NO	BOBN@W-TEK.COM			YES

THIS INCLUDES NATIVE AND LABELED CHLORINATED DIOXINS AND DIBENZOFURANS.  THESE SUBSTANCES ARE PERIODICALLY MANUFACTURED ON A VERY SMALL SCALE AND HELD IN INVENTORY UNTIL NEEDED FOR FURTHER PROCESSING.  SMALL QUANTITIES OF THESE RAW MATERIALS ARE FORMULATED INTO VARIOUS DILUTE CONCENTRATION REFERENCE STANDARDS.  CERILLIANT TESTS OUTDATED MATERIALS AND RE-CERTIFIES THEM FOR CONTINUED USE WHENEVER POSSIBLE.  CONSIDERATION IS GIVEN TO RECOVERING AND REUSING RAW MATERIALS FROM FORMULATIONS THAT ARE OUTDATED AND CAN NOT BE RE-CERTIFIED.  IN MANY CASES, ONLY ENOUGH RAW MATERIAL REQUIRED TO BE CARRIED FORWARD IN THE FORMULATED STANDARD IS MANUFACTURED, THUS MINIMIZING THE AMOUNT OF RAW MATERIAL MADE.  WHEN MANUFACTURING THE RAW MATERIALS, REACTION VESSELS ARE CONFIGURED IN A CLOSED SYSTEM DESIGN, WHICH INCLUDES TRAPS TO ELIMINATE THE POSSIBILITY OF AIR EMISSIONS.
