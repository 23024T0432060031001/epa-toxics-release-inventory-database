19703CTSTL4001P	1307205905538	N458	MERCURY COMPOUNDS	PBT	2007	CLAYMONT STEEL	4001 PHILADELPHIA PIKE	CLAYMONT	NEW CASTLE	DE	19703	YES	NO	NO	NO								331221						39.807579	-75.448381	188183891										CLAYMONT STEEL RECYCLES APPROXIMATELY 500,000 TONS PER YEAR OF SCRAP STEEL IN AN ELECTRIC ARC FURNACE (EAF).  THE USEPA IDENTIFIED EAF SHOPS AS SOURCES OF MERCURY EMISSIONS WHICH CAN BE TRACED TO THE SCRAP METAL FEEDSTOCK THAT IS USED TO PRODUCE STEEL.  THE PRIMARY SOURCE OF MERCURY CONTAMINATION IN SCRAP METAL IS FROM MERCURY SWITCHES USED IN AUTOMOBILE HOOD AND TRUNK CONVENIENCE LIGHTING.  WHEN THESE DEVICES ARE NOT REMOVED PRIOR TO CRUSHING AND SHREDDING THE SCRAPPED AUTOMOBILES, THE MERCURY BECOMES ENTRAINED IN THE SCRAP AND VOLATILIZED IN THE MELTING PROCESS.  CLAYMONT STEEL AND OTHER EAF RECYCLERS DO NOT WANT OR RECEIVE ANY BENEFIT FROM MERCURY IN THE SCRAP METAL RECEIVED FROM SUPPLIERS IN THE REGION.    CLAYMONT STEEL REMAINS COMMITTED TO REDUCE MERCURY EMISSIONS FROM THIS FACILITY.  TO THIS END, CLAYMONT STEEL HAS IMPLEMENTED A NUMBER OF SOURCE REDUCTION MEASURES TO REDUCE MERCURY FROM ENTERING THE EAF VIA THE SCRAP METAL FEED.  THESE INITIAL MEASURES ARE PART OF AN OVERALL POLLUTION PREVENTION PROGRAM TO FURTHER REDUCE THE AMOUNT OF MERCURY IN THE EAF FEED AND TO REDUCE MERCURY EMISSIONS.  CLAYMONT STEEL BELIEVES THIS IS THE MOST EXPEDITIOUS AND ENVIRONMENTALLY BENEFICIAL ALTERNATIVE. THE SOURCE REDUCTION MEASURES ARE DISCUSSED BELOW:    NATIONAL VEHICLE MERCURY SWITCH REMOVAL PROGRAM (NVMSRP).   CLAYMONT STEEL JOINED FORCES WITH OTHER MEMBERS OF THE STEEL MANUFACTURERS ASSOCIATION (SMA) AND THE AMERICAN IRON AND STEEL INSTITUTE (AISI) TO ESTABLISH THE NVMSRP.   CLAYMONT STEEL ENTERED INTO THIS AGREEMENT WITH OTHER STEELMAKERS TO FULLY FUND THE NVMSRP OVER A THREE YEAR PERIOD.    FOSTER RELATIONSHIPS WITH SUPPLIERS WHO PARTICIPATE IN THE NVMSRP.  CLAYMONT STEEL WILL CONTINUE TO PURCHASE FROM SUPPLIERS WHO PARTICIPATE IN THE NVMSRP.  ULTIMATELY, THIS IS THE MOST ENVIRONMENTALLY BENEFICIAL PROGRAM BECAUSE THE MERCURY IS RECOVERED AND RECYCLED IN A SEPARATE STREAM RATHER THAN ALLOWING THE MERCURY SWITCH TO BE SHREDDED AND VOLATILIZED IN AN EAF AT A STEELMAKING FACILITY.   CLAYMONT STEEL HAS NOTIFIED SUPPLIERS INDICATING THAT WE INTEND TO UTILIZE, TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT POSSIBLE, SCRAP FROM VEHICLES WHICH DO NOT CONTAIN MERCURY FROM SWITCHES OR SCRAP FROM VEHICLES THAT HAVE HAD MERCURY SWITCHES REMOVED.  THE SUPPLIERS HAVE BEEN AUDITED TO ASSESS THEIR PARTICIPATION IN THE PROGRAM AND THEIR ABILITY TO MEET OUR PURCHASE SPECIFICATIONS.    AUTO-FREE SHRED.  CLAYMONT STEEL HAS ARRANGED FOR OUR SHREDDED SCRAP SUPPLIERS TO SUPPLY SHRED THAT DOES NOT CONTAIN AUTOMOBILES.  SINCE MERCURY CONVENIENCE SWITCHES FROM END-OF-LIFE AUTOMOBILES IS THE PREDOMINANT SOURCE OF MERCURY IN STEEL SCRAP, THE ELIMINATION OF THIS SCRAP SOURCE HAS ALREADY PROVIDED AN IMMEDIATE REDUCTION IN MERCURY EMISSIONS.  WE HAVE AUDITED THESE SUPPLIERS AND FOUND THAT THESE SUPPLIERS HAVE SATISFACTORY PROCEDURES IN PLACE.  THE VOLUME OF AUTO-FREE SHRED IN THE REGION IS LIMITED, SO CLAYMONT STEEL ALSO PURCHASES SHREDDED SCRAP FROM SUPPLIERS WHO HAVE A DOCUMENTED MERCURY REMOVAL PROGRAM.     NO SHRED FROM MUNICIPAL SOURCES.  CLAYMONT STEEL HAS CEASED USING SHREDDED STEEL SCRAP FROM MUNICIPAL WASTE INCINERATORS.  THIS COMMERCIAL FERROUS SCRAP IS MAGNETICALLY RECOVERED FROM RESIDUAL AND COMMERCIAL WASTE COMBUSTION FACILITIES AND THERE IS A CONCERN THAT THERE COULD BE RESIDUAL MERCURY IN THIS SOURCE OF SCRAP IN THE FORM OF THERMOSTATS, MANOMETERS, BUTTON CELL BATTERIES, FLAME SENSORS AND OTHER MERCURY-TILT SWITCHES.    REVISE THE SCRAP MIX.  CLAYMONT STEEL HAS REDUCED THE AMOUNT OF SHREDDED SCRAP CHARGED TO THE EAF AS A PERCENTAGE OF TOTAL FEEDSTOCK.  OTHER SCRAP GRADES NOT CONTAINING AUTO SCRAP HAVE BEEN SUBSTITUTED TO THE EXTENT THEY ARE AVAILABLE AND FEASIBLE.	NO				YES
