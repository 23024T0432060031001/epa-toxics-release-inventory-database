Of the 30% that did not adhere to the ship (20351# of copper compounds), 10% of that (2035#) are assumed to have escaped as particulate, leaving 18316#.  Half of the balance of 18316# (or 9158#) is assumed to have adhered to the blasting grit on the drydock floor (which is hauled by Charter Environmental after TCLP), and the other half (9158#) is assumed to have adhered to the blocks that support the ship, the tarps, and the drydock itself.  It is estimated that about 10% of this portion (or about 916#) ends up on the tarps, which have a service life of about 1 year.  The tarps are removed via dumpster by EZ Disposal Service Inc.  To summarize, of the 67838# of copper compounds, 47487# end up on the ship, 2035# are emitted to the atmosphere as particulate matter, 9158# are disposed with the blasting grit after negative TCLP (Charter Environmental), 916# are disposed with the tarps (EZ Disposal Services), and 8242# end up on the blocks and other drydock structures.
