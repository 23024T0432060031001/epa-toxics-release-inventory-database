(See attached leak detection summary sheets.) ¿ Weekly solvent use meetings with key management personnel. ¿ Plant Air Quality Improvement Project  ¿ The project was undertaken in 2005 and it was completed near years end of 2006. The project consisted of several walls that were built within the production facility to separate the extrusion/calendaring operations from the extraction-product molding/drying operations.  The walls separate smoke emitting activities from TCE emitting activities.  The process oil has very low levels of residual TCE now and the bag houses and fiber beds exhaust streams are now discharged to atmosphere.  Roughly 32,000 ft3/min of air, or half the current SLA capacity is currently used in key areas of the plant to reduce fugitives.  A side effect of this discharge that we expect is extended activated carbon life because historically baghouse dust and PAQ oil smoke have contaminated the carbon.    ¿ The project reduced overall plant site Trichloroethylene emissions from 113.3 tons in 2006  to 58.9 tons annually by year end of 2007.  In addition to separating the extraction-(sheet properties setting) & winding sections from the rest of the production operation with walls, we also added  a Trichloroethylene monitoring system in order to monitor potential fugitive zones and take action to minimize zone concentrations through process adjustments.
