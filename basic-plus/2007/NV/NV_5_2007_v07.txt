IN FACT, WE DID NOT MEET THE MINIMUM QUANTITY REQUIREMENTS OF OUR OFFSITE RECYCLER TO PICK UP AND RECYCLE OUR DROSS IN 2007. I THINK WE WILL MEET THE MINIMUM QUANTITY REQUIREMENT FOR THE RECYCLER SOMETIME IN 2008. IF NOT, WE'LL HAVE TO PAY A PREMIUM TO HAVE THE DROSS THAT'S STILL IN HOUSE RECYCLED.  2006, OUR INDUSTRY IS SLOWING MOVING AWAY FROM LEAD BASED SOLDER. WE HAVE PURCHASED THE APPROPRIATE EQUIPMENT TO PROCESS LEAD FREE SOLDER. ADDITIONALLY IN 2007 WE ACTUALLY STARTED PROCESSING LEAD FREE PRODUCT.
