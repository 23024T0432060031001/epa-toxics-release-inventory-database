THE UNITS WERE SHUTDOWN FOR COMPREHENSIVE PM, IN ACCORDANCE WITH MANUFACTURER RECOMMENDATIONS.  2) ADJUSTED THE PRODUCTION PAINT SCHEDULE AND THE CREW NOW PREDOMINANTLY WORK 4 DAYS,10 HOUR SHIFTS WITH NO PAINT ACTIVITY ON DAY 5. THIS SCHEDULE RESULTS IN LESS START-UP AND SHUT-DOWNS AND LESS PRODUCTION IRREGULARITIES.  3) IN JANUARY 2011, FULL DUCTWORK MAINTENANCE OF THE CAPTURE SYSTEM WAS CONDUCTED WITH VERY THOROUGH CLEANING. 4) IIMPLEMENTED A NEW TYPE OF PAINT THAT REQUIRES LESS COATING THICKNESS WHICH LEAD TO A USAGE REDUCTION FOR THE SAME AREA PAINTED FOR ONE SPECIFIC PRODUCT LINE AND WILL CONTINUE TO ROLL-OUT THIS COATING TO OTHER PRODUCT LINES. 5) EXTERIA BUILDING PRODUCTS IS ALSO INVESTIGATING TO MOVE CERTAIN AUTOMATED SPRAY APPLICATIONS TO A MANUAL OPERATION. AN OPERATOR CAN SPECIFICALLY SPRAY CERTAIN STONE DETAILS. WHEREAS AN AUTOMATED SPRAY-BOOTH APPLIES A WIDE-AREA COVERAGE AND LAYS PAINT NOT ONLY ON THE FINISHED PRODUCT BUT ALSO ON A MASK THAT DOES NOT NEED TO BE PAINTED.

THE UNITS WERE SHUTDOWN FOR COMPREHENSIVE PM, IN ACCORDANCE WITH MANUFACTURER RECOMMENDATIONS.  2) ADJUSTED THE PRODUCTION PAINT SCHEDULE AND THE CREW NOW PREDOMINANTLY WORK 4 DAYS,10 HOUR SHIFTS WITH NO PAINT ACTIVITY ON DAY 5. THIS SCHEDULE RESULTS IN LESS START-UP AND SHUT-DOWNS AND LESS PRODUCTION IRREGULARITIES.  3) IN JANUARY 2011, FULL DUCTWORK MAINTENANCE OF THE CAPTURE SYSTEM WAS CONDUCTED WITH VERY THOROUGH CLEANING. 4) IIMPLEMENTED A NEW TYPE OF PAINT THAT REQUIRES LESS COATING THICKNESS WHICH LEAD TO A USAGE REDUCTION FOR THE SAME AREA PAINTED FOR ONE SPECIFIC PRODUCT LINE AND WILL CONTINUE TO ROLL-OUT THIS COATING TO OTHER PRODUCT LINES. 5) EXTERIA BUILDING PRODUCTS IS ALSO INVESTIGATING TO MOVE CERTAIN AUTOMATED SPRAY APPLICATIONS TO A MANUAL OPERATION. AN OPERATOR CAN SPECIFICALLY SPRAY CERTAIN STONE DETAILS. WHEREAS AN AUTOMATED SPRAY-BOOTH APPLIES A WIDE-AREA COVERAGE AND LAYS PAINT NOT ONLY ON THE FINISHED PRODUCT BUT ALSO ON A MASK THAT DOES NOT NEED TO BE PAINTED.

THE UNITS WERE SHUTDOWN FOR COMPREHENSIVE PM, IN ACCORDANCE WITH MANUFACTURER RECOMMENDATIONS.  2) ADJUSTED THE PRODUCTION PAINT SCHEDULE AND THE CREW NOW PREDOMINANTLY WORK 4 DAYS,10 HOUR SHIFTS WITH NO PAINT ACTIVITY ON DAY 5. THIS SCHEDULE RESULTS IN LESS START-UP AND SHUT-DOWNS AND LESS PRODUCTION IRREGULARITIES.  3) IN JANUARY 2011, FULL DUCTWORK MAINTENANCE OF THE CAPTURE SYSTEM WAS CONDUCTED WITH VERY THOROUGH CLEANING. 4) IIMPLEMENTED A NEW TYPE OF PAINT THAT REQUIRES LESS COATING THICKNESS WHICH LEAD TO A USAGE REDUCTION FOR THE SAME AREA PAINTED FOR ONE SPECIFIC PRODUCT LINE AND WILL CONTINUE TO ROLL-OUT THIS COATING TO OTHER PRODUCT LINES. 5) EXTERIA BUILDING PRODUCTS IS ALSO INVESTIGATING TO MOVE CERTAIN AUTOMATED SPRAY APPLICATIONS TO A MANUAL OPERATION. AN OPERATOR CAN SPECIFICALLY SPRAY CERTAIN STONE DETAILS. WHEREAS AN AUTOMATED SPRAY-BOOTH APPLIES A WIDE-AREA COVERAGE AND LAYS PAINT NOT ONLY ON THE FINISHED PRODUCT BUT ALSO ON A MASK THAT DOES NOT NEED TO BE PAINTED.

IT IS THE GOAL OF KOS TO REDUCE THE GENERATION OF ALL CLASS I AND HAZARDOUS WASTES OR, AT A MINIMUM FOR THOSE WASTES THAT MUST BE GENERATED, HAVE THEM RECYCLED WHERE FEASIBLE. THESE CHEMICALS, FOR THE MOST PART, BECOME PART OF THE MANUFACTURED ARTICLE, BUT ARE NOT CONSIDERED EXEMPT FOR REPORTING PURPOSES. WHEN AVAILABLE, KOS ATTEMPTS TO EDUCATE THE CLIENT IN NON-WASTE GENERATING MANUFACTURING PROCEDURES AND CONSTITUENTS AS ALTERNATIVES TO THE INITIAL PRODUCT SPECIFICATION.  KOS WILL CONTINUE TO PURSUE THE IDENTIFICATION OF PRODUCTS AND CHEMICALS USED IN ITS PRIMARY ACTIVITIES TO ALLOW THE CLIENT AND KOS TO REDUCE ITS IMPACT ON THE ENVIRONMENT. THE VOLUME RELEASE OR USE OF TRI REPORTABLE CHEMICALS AND/OR THE GENERATION OF HAZARDOUS WASTES AT THE KOS FACILITY WILL BE DEPENDENT ON THE INDUSTRY DEMAND AND NECESSARY PRODUCTION, WHICH FLUCTUATES ANNUALLY. THEREFORE, IT IS DIFFICULT TO MEASURE OR PROJECT SPECIFIC REDUCTIONS. AS DESCRIBED EARLIER, THE GENERATION OF ALL CLASS I AND HAZARDOUS WASTES OR, AT A MINIMUM FOR THOSE WASTES THAT MUST BE GENERATED, HAVE THEM RECYCLED WHERE FEASIBLE.

THE MANUFACTURER OF THE DISTILLATION UNITS CLAIMED THE UNITS WOULD RECYCLE THE STODDARD SOLVENT IN THE TANKS IN 4 TO 8 HOURS.  THE DISTILLED RESIDUE WOULD THEN BE ACCUMULATED FOR PROPER DISPOSAL.  THE UNITS NEVER PERFORMED AS ADVERTISED.    STP IS INVESTIGATING THE PURCHASE OR LEASE OF A LARGER STAND ALONE DISTILLATION UNIT TO HELP REDUCE THE USAGE OF STODDARD SOLVENT.  THIS PROJECT WILL CONTINUE TO BE INVESTIGATED IN 2011. IF IMPLEMENTED, THIS WOULD RESULT IN OFF-SITE DISPOSAL OF STILL BOTTOMS CONTAINING METALS VERSUS DRUMS OF SPENT STODDARD SOLVENT CONTAINING METALS.  IN 2011, STP DID NOT IMPLEMENT ON-SITE SOLVENT DISTILLATION.

THE 2008 REPORT FOR NITRIC ACID LISTED 2575 POUNDS "8.1D TOTAL OTHER OFF-SITE DISPOSAL OR OTHER RELEASES".  AFTER CONSULTATION WITH THE EPA, WE DETERMINED THAT THESE WERE ACTUALLY SALES OF PRODUCT, AND NOT OFF-SITE DISPOSAL OF WASTE.  WE MANUFACTURE CHEMICALS TO VERY LOW TOLERANCES FOR CONTAMINATION FOR THE SEMICONDUCTOR INDUSTRY.  THE CHEMICAL WE DECLARED IN 2008 WAS ACTUALLY SOLD AS "TECH-GRADE" CHEMICAL AFTER THE SATALLITE TESTING FACILITY AT THE SEMICONDUCTOR CUSTOMER'S SITE DETERMINED THAT THE CONTAMINATION LEVEL WAS TOO HIGH TO USE IN SEMICONDUCTOR FACILITIES (PARTS PER BILLION CONTAMINATION).

SINCE ONE VOLUME OF NITROGEN WEIGHS FOURTEEN TIMES AS MUCH AS ONE VOLUME OF HYDROGEN, ON A WEIGHT BASIS, THE RATIO IS FOURTEEN PARTS OF NITROGEN TO THREE PARTS OF HYDROGEN, OR ABOUT 82% NITROGEN AND 18 % HYDROGEN. AT ATMOSPHERIC TEMPERATURES AND PRESSURES, ANHYDROUS AMMONIA IS A PUNGENT COLORLESS GAS. ANHYDROUS AMMONIA BOILS AT -28Â°F (AT 1 ATM) AND FREEZES TO A WHITE CRYSTALLINE MASS AT -108Â°F. WHEN HEATED ABOVE ITS CRITICAL TEMPERATURE OF 271.4Â°F, AMMONIA EXIST ONLY AS A VAPOR REGARDLESS OF THE PRESSURE. BETWEEN THE MELTING AND CRITICAL POINTS, LIQUID AMMONIA EXERTS A VAPOR PRESSURE, WHICH INCREASES WITH RISING TEMPERATURE. WHEN LIQUID AMMONIA IS IN A CLOSED CONTAINER IT IS IN EQUILIBRIUM WITH AMMONIA VAPOR AND THE PRESSURE WITHIN THE CONTAINER BEARS A DEFINITE RELATIONSHIP TO THE TEMPERATURE. ABOVE 900Â°F, AMMONIA BEGINS TO DECOMPOSE, REVERTING TO HYDROGEN AND NITROGEN. THE PROCESS AT WOODWORTH INC., INVOLVES AMMONIA BEING INTRODUCED INTO THE FURNACES AS A VAPOR. THE NITROGEN IS DIFFUSED INTO THE SURFACE LAYER OF THE METAL AND THE HYDROGEN IS EXHAUSTED TO THE FURNACE BURN-OFF STACK, WHERE IT IS MIXED WITH NATURAL GAS AND IT IS IGNITED BY A PYROTECHNIC DEVICE TO INSURE COMPLETE COMBUSTION.

OUR GOAL IS TO CONTINUOUSLY TEST NEW GEL-COAT AND RESIN MATERIALS, AS THEY BECOME AVAILABLE.  WE HAVE PRIMARILY FOCUSED ON LOW-VOC INPUT MATERIALS AS A METHOD TO REDUCE EMISSIONS.  IN RECENT YEARS WE HAVE MOVED TO LOW-HAPS GEL COATS. WE ANTICIPATE THE FUTURE WILL SEE LOWER HAPS IN ALL PRODUCTS WE USE.   WE CONTINUE TO MINIMIZE WASTE DUE TO OVER-MIXING OF RESIN BATCHES OR DEFECTIVE FINAL PRODUCTS.  THE AMOUNT OF RESIN AND FILLER NEEDED FOR EACH SERIES OF MOLDS IS WELL ESTABLISHED AND IS CONVEYED EFFECTIVELY TO OUR EMPLOYEES.  THIS RESULTS IN VERY LITTLE EXCESS PREPARATION OF THE RESIN/FILLER MIXTURE.  LIKEWISE, OUR CONTINUED ATTENTION TO QUALITY HAS RESULTED IN A VERY SMALL NUMBER OF DEFECTIVE FINAL PRODUCTS.  THE IMPORTANCE OF REDUCING THESE SOURCES OF PRODUCT WASTE IS WELL UNDERSTOOD BY PRODUCTION SUPERVISORS AND EMPLOYEES, AND IS FULLY INTEGRATED INTO OUR TOTAL QUALITY MANAGEMENT SYSTEM.  WE WILL ALSO CONTINUE TO SEARCH FOR A METHOD OF APPLYING THE GEL COAT THAT WILL EFFECTIVELY COAT THE MOLD WHILE REDUCING THE AMOUNT OF OVERSPRAY.  AFTER CAREFUL CONSIDERATION, WE HAVE DETERMINED THAT AUTOMATING THIS SPRAY COATING OPERATION WOULD NOT RESULT IN LESS OVERSPRAY THAN APPLICATION BY A WELL-TRAINED EMPLOYEE.

TIPP CITY "FIRST PASS RIGHT" QUALITY INITIATIVE.  AS ONE MIGHT EXPECT, THE DOWNTURN IN ECONOMY HAS NOT BEEN KIND TO THE DAP TIPP CITY FACILITY.  THE DAP TIPP CITY FACILITY HAS BEEN EXPLORING METHODS FOR POLLUTION REDUCTION IN ITS OPERATIONS.  ONE OF OUR SUCCESS STORIES IS THE FACILITY'S "FIRST PASS RIGHT" PROGRAM. THIS IS A PROGRAM WHERE THE FACILITY ENDEAVORS TO MAKE BATCHES CORRECTLY THE FIRST TIME.  IF WE MAKE BATCHES CORRECTLY THE FIRST TIME, THEN THE FACILITY OPTIMIZES THE USE OF A.  RAW MATERIALS (AIR, SOLID WASTE AND HAZARDOUS WASTE POLLUTION IS MINIMIZED IF THE BATCH IS CORRECT ON THE FIRST TRIAL).  B.  ENERGY (USED TO DRIVE THE FACILITIES EQUIPMENT AND PROCESSES IS MINIMIZED IF THE BATCH IS CORRECT ON THE FIRST TRIAL).  DUE TO THE HARD WORK OF OUR ASSOCIATES, THE DAP TIPP CITY FACILITY WAS ABLE TO RAISE ITS FIRST TIME RIGHT PERCENTAGE FROM 76.4% IN CY 2010 TO 79.8% IN CY 2011.  PROCESS ENHANCEMENTS - THE DAP TIPP CITY FACILITY HAS PURCHASED TOOLING AND IMPLEMENTED PROCEDURES THAT ALLOW THE FACILITIES 4-STEM CARTRIDGE FILLER TO COMPLETELY EMPTY THE TANKS SUPPLYING THE 4-STEM CARTRIDGE FILLER.  THIS PREVENTS WHAT PREVIOUSLY WASTE IN THE BOTTOM OF THE MIXING TANK FROM BEING THROWN AWAY.

THE UNITS WERE SHUTDOWN FOR COMPREHENSIVE PM, IN ACCORDANCE WITH MANUFACTURER RECOMMENDATIONS.  2) ADJUSTED THE PRODUCTION PAINT SCHEDULE AND THE CREW NOW PREDOMINANTLY WORK 4 DAYS,10 HOUR SHIFTS WITH NO PAINT ACTIVITY ON DAY 5. THIS SCHEDULE RESULTS IN LESS START-UP AND SHUT-DOWNS AND LESS PRODUCTION IRREGULARITIES.  3) IN JANUARY 2011, FULL DUCTWORK MAINTENANCE OF THE CAPTURE SYSTEM WAS CONDUCTED WITH VERY THOROUGH CLEANING. 4) IIMPLEMENTED A NEW TYPE OF PAINT THAT REQUIRES LESS COATING THICKNESS WHICH LEAD TO A USAGE REDUCTION FOR THE SAME AREA PAINTED FOR ONE SPECIFIC PRODUCT LINE AND WILL CONTINUE TO ROLL-OUT THIS COATING TO OTHER PRODUCT LINES. 5) EXTERIA BUILDING PRODUCTS IS ALSO INVESTIGATING TO MOVE CERTAIN AUTOMATED SPRAY APPLICATIONS TO A MANUAL OPERATION. AN OPERATOR CAN SPECIFICALLY SPRAY CERTAIN STONE DETAILS. WHEREAS AN AUTOMATED SPRAY-BOOTH APPLIES A WIDE-AREA COVERAGE AND LAYS PAINT NOT ONLY ON THE FINISHED PRODUCT BUT ALSO ON A MASK THAT DOES NOT NEED TO BE PAINTED.
