One machine processes leaded dross; the other machine processes lead-free dross. The recycling process is as follows:  Both hot leaded and lead-free solder dross are taken from the leaded and lead-free wave soldering machines and placed into dross buckets. From the dross buckets, the dross is placed into each of the SMIC FA System dross recycling machines (leaded and lead free).  Much of the dross inside the recycling machines is reduced to dust and placed into 55-gallon drums for waste disposal; and a portion remains inside the machine. The remaining dross inside the recycling machines is recycled for further use in the wave soldering machines. Thus, it reduces our dross waste disposal and cost for purchasing solder bar.  The recycling machines are SMIC Model SDS2-5N manufactured in July, 2011.	NO	LEONARDO.BALBUENA@ASTEELFLASH.COM			YES

Wolverine has fully integrated the program as a key component to business operations; equal to production, quality, and safety. The program focuses on continuous inventory reduction and maintenance, ongoing efficiency improvement, and overall plant organization. Copper and Silver are the key components in all of the brazing products we manufacture so as we continue to reduce inventory and improve efficiency, we continue to find ways to reduce our toxic substances. We hold several plant organizational meetings, business improvement planning, and, production cell kaizen blitz's per year. They have all not only resulted in cost savings for the business, but have also  improved recycling and material handling methods and lowered the volume of on-hand inventory of our reportable substances throughout the facility. Due to the increase in silver prices in 2010, we had a large reduction in our on-hand silver inventory and an increase in our on-site recycling activity.	NO	APOWERS@LUCASMILHAUPT.COM			YES

After the installation of equipment was complete, the operation first began in December, 2010, and it continued throughout 2011.  Much of the fiber that was once disposed of in the facility's landfill is now reclaimed, and the fiber is able to return into the mill's process or into another facility's process for manufacturing paper.  The fiber sludge that is now disposed of in the landfill is solely deposited there to be used as an alternative cover for dirt, aiding in covering wastes to meet landfill regulations.  In essence, the facility is now able to reduce the toxins being disposed of to the landfill via sludge while maintaining the same paper manufacturing productivity.	NO	AWINTERS@GBP.COM			NO

Some of nitrate ion is consumed in the process, and some remains as a residual at the end of the pipe, and this is what is reported.  In 2011, the feedstock was changed from a chemical with the trade name of "Bioxide" to "Trioxyn".  The change caused the process to be more stable, and this in turn allowed a reduction in the amount of nitrate ion added to the process.

After the installation of equipment was complete, the operation first began in December, 2010, and it continued throughout 2011.  Much of the fiber that was once disposed of in the facility's landfill is now reclaimed, and the fiber is able to return into the mill's process or into another facility's process for manufacturing paper.  The fiber sludge that is now disposed of in the landfill is solely deposited there to be used as an alternative cover for dirt, aiding in covering wastes to meet landfill regulations.  In essence, the facility is now able to reduce the toxins being disposed of to the landfill via sludge while maintaining the same paper manufacturing productivity.	NO	AWINTERS@GBP.COM			YES

Using a paint transfer efficiency of 70%, 20,663# of copper compounds adhered to the ships.  Of the 30% that did not adhere to the ships (8855# of copper compounds), 10% of that (886#) are assumed to have escaped as particulate, leaving 7969#.  Half of the balance of 7969# (3985#) is assumed to have adhered to the blasting grit on the drydock floor (which is hauled by Charter Environmental after TCLP), and the other half (3985#) is assumed to have adhered to the blocks that support the ship, the tarps, and the drydock itself.  It is estimated that about 10% of this portion (or about 398# ) ends up on the tarps which have a service life of about 1 year.  The tarps are removed via dumpster by EZ Disposal Service Inc.  To summarize, of the 29,518# of copper compounds, 20,663# end up on the ship, 886# are emitted to the atmosphere as particulate matter, 3985# are disposed with the blasting grit after negative TCLP (Charter Environmental), 398# are disposed with the tarps (EZ Disposal Services), and 3586# end up on the blocks and on other drydock structures.  Note:  Even though the gallons of product used in 2011 was 2.08 times the gallons used in 2010, the amount of copper in the paints that were applied in 2011 was only 75% of the amount of copper reported in 2010.

After the installation of equipment was complete, the operation first began in December, 2010, and it continued throughout 2011.  Much of the fiber that was once disposed of in the facility's landfill is now reclaimed, and the fiber is able to return into the mill's process or into another facility's process for manufacturing paper.  The fiber sludge that is now disposed of in the landfill is solely deposited there to be used as an alternative cover for dirt, aiding in covering wastes to meet landfill regulations.  In essence, the facility is now able to reduce the toxins being disposed of to the landfill via sludge while maintaining the same paper manufacturing productivity.	NO	AWINTERS@GBP.COM			NO

Since one volume of nitrogen weighs fourteen times as much as one volume of hydrogen, on a weight basis, the ratio is fourteen parts of nitrogen to three parts of hydrogen, or about 82% nitrogen and 18 % hydrogen. At atmospheric temperatures and pressures, anhydrous ammonia is a pungent colorless gas. Anhydrous ammonia boils at -28Â°F (at 1 atm) and freezes to a white crystalline mass at -108Â°F. When heated above its critical temperature of 271.4Â°F, ammonia exist only as a vapor regardless of the pressure. Between the melting and critical points, liquid ammonia exerts a vapor pressure, which increases with rising temperature. When liquid ammonia is in a closed container it is in equilibrium with ammonia vapor and the pressure within the container bears a definite relationship to the temperature. Above 900Â°F, ammonia begins to decompose, reverting to hydrogen and nitrogen. The process at Woodworth Inc., involves ammonia being introduced into the furnaces as a vapor. The nitrogen is diffused into the surface layer of the metal and the hydrogen is exhausted to the furnace burn-off stack, where it is mixed with natural gas and it is ignited by a pyrotechnic device to insure complete combustion.

The Humble facility is obligated to file TRI reports because the carbon steel grades processed at this facility include approximately 1% Manganese plus or minus other reportable trace metal components.  The releases from this facility include the following:  (1) Releases to air from welding operations, which are estimated using published EPA emission factors (AP-42) and material through-puts. (2) Minor releases to landfills due to small quantities of fine metal particles becoming unavoidably entrained in plant trash (mostly from floor sweepings; larger scrap metal pieces are re-used rather than disposed of).  Landfill releases are estimated using conservative mass balance assumptions.    This facility's operations are limited to structural fabrication and the facility does not engage in any surface abrasion, surface coating, or surface cleaning processes that would be expected to generate additional TRI-reportable organic or inorganic substances.

The manufacturer of the distillation units claimed the units would recycle the stoddard solvent in the tanks in 4 to 8 hours.  The distilled residue would then be accumulated for proper disposal.  The units never performed as advertised.  Stp is investigating the purchase or lease of a larger stand alone distillation unit to help reduce the usage of stoddard solvent.  This project will continue to be investigated in 2011.  If implemented, this would result in off-Site disposal of still bottoms containing metals versus drums of spent stoddard solvent containing metals.  In 2011, stp did not implement on-Site solvent distillation.  In 2012, stp will continue to investigate on-Site solvent distillation in 2012, stp is investigating the possibility of managing spent solvent as a hazardous secondary material.  Stp is working with safety-Kleen systems to determine if this is a feasible option.

In 2010, stp started to investigate the change from animal fat based lubricant to petroleum based lubricants on straight length tubing.

This spent solution is currently disposed of as a corrosive hazardous waste containing copper, nickel, lead, chromium, chromium (Vi) and other heavy metals.  This project will continue to be investigated in 2011.  In 2011, stp started to experiment with petroleum based lubricants to draw straight length tubing.

Prior to this, all liquid MIBK wastes were shipped offsite to be combusted for energy recovery.   During RY2011, 45% of liquid MIBK wastes were recycled and repurchased by the operation to be used for certain cleaning and R&D activities.  Pending success in qualifying the use of reclaimed solvent in other areas of the process, the operation plans to increase the proportion of reclaimed MIBK to between 60 and 70% of MIBK used .   This recycling activity benefits the operation by reducing the amount of virgin solvent purchased.  Because the cost of repurchasing reclaimed MIBK is approximately $4.25 per gallon, compared with $24 per gallon for virgin MIBK, the operation anticipates a reduction of up to 49% in annual MIBK raw material costs.-W49:The operation qualified the use of reclaimed solvent in certain areas of the process.;W58:Redirection of liquid solvent wastes for reclaim and reuse, rather than for energy recovery.;T04:A cross-functional team consisting of operations personnel, Environmental Management Operations, and Global Purchasing planned and implemented the recycling project.;T11:Successful implementation of other solvent reclaim and reuse operations at Xerox provided inspiration for this project.

These float switches could be mercury based switches.  This non-mercury liquid level sensing product also works in conjunction with a control panel. For the reporting year 2011, we are offering more different types of control panels that work with this new liquid level sensor to fit different types of liquid level control applications.

The manufacturer of the distillation units claimed the units would recycle the stoddard solvent in the tanks in 4 to 8 hours.  The distilled residue would then be accumulated for proper disposal.  The units never performed as advertised.  Stp is investigating the purchase or lease of a larger stand alone distillation unit to help reduce the usage of stoddard solvent.  This project will continue to be investigated in 2011.  If implemented, this would result in off-Site disposal of still bottoms containing metals versus drums of spent stoddard solvent containing metals.  In 2011, stp did not implement on-Site solvent distillation.  In 2012, stp will continue to investigate on-Site solvent distillation in 2012, stp is investigating the possibility of managing spent solvent as a hazardous secondary material.

This Oxygen at high temperature reacts with the charge to form  Oxides of Crome,Cobalt etc in the form of slag. It also creates Oxide effluent gas which goes in the air. SPAL process uses liquid Argon which being heavier forms a blanket over the molten metal in the furnace.Liquid Argon epands 800 times and it pushes the air(Oxygen) out of the furnace.

Wolverine has fully integrated the program as a key component to business operations; equal to production, quality, and safety. The program focuses on continuous inventory reduction and maintenance, ongoing efficiency improvement, and overall plant organization. Copper and Silver are the key components in all of the brazing products we manufacture so as we continue to reduce inventory and improve efficiency, we continue to find ways to reduce our toxic substances. We hold several plant organizational meetings, business improvement planning, and, production cell kaizen blitz's per year. They have all not only resulted in cost savings for the business, but have also  improved recycling and material handling methods and lowered the volume of on-hand inventory of our reportable substances throughout the facility. Due to the increase in silver prices in 2010, we had a large reduction in our on-hand silver inventory and an increase in our on-site recycling activity.	NO	APOWERS@LUCASMILHAUPT.COM			YES

A brief discussion of 2011 activities is as follows:   1) Annual preventative maintenance (PM).  The units were shutdown for comprehensive PM, in accordance with manufacturer recommendations.  2) Adjusted the production paint schedule and the crew now predominantly work 4 days,10 hour shifts with no paint activity on day 5. This schedule results in less start-up and shut-downs and less production irregularities.  3) In January 2011, full ductwork maintenance of the capture system was conducted with very thorough cleaning. 4) Iimplemented a new type of paint that requires less coating thickness which lead to a usage reduction for the same area painted for one specific product line and will continue to roll-out this coating to other product lines. 5) Exteria Building Products is also investigating to move certain automated spray applications to a manual operation. An operator can specifically spray certain stone details. Whereas an automated spray-booth applies a wide-area coverage and lays paint not only on the finished product but also on a mask that does not need to be painted. Going to a manual operation can yield up to 80% paint and thus source reduction for one specific product line.	NO	MHODGE@DERBYBP.COM			NO

In order to acquire this permit, the facility has instituted numerous improvements in work practices with the guidance of the Toledo Department of Air, an independent consultant and internal company personnel. Work practice improvements include: a new database to track solvent usage; use of self latching funnels; use of drip trays for expeditious removal of collected solvent; inspection of tubing/connections for leaks/release points; use of pumps to transfer solvents; the use of caps on fraction collection bottles with openings to insert the collection tubing through to control emissions; clean in place regeneration for large columns; etc. Although many of these practices were instituted in late 2009/2010 the full results are curently being seen insofar as the facility had a substantial increase in production for 2011 but an actual reduction in emissions when compared to 2010.

(KOS) facility began its construction in July 2001 in Ingleside, Texas. Based on industry knowledge, waste minimization, disposal, and recycling practices were identified and implemented from the inception of the facility. It is the goal of KOS to reduce the generation of all Class I and hazardous wastes or, at a minimum for those wastes that must be generated, have them recycled where feasible. These chemicals, for the most part, become part of the manufactured article, but are not considered exempt for reporting purposes. When available, KOS attempts to educate the client in non-waste generating manufacturing procedures and constituents as alternatives to the initial product specification.  KOS will continue to pursue the identification of products and chemicals used in its primary activities to allow the client and KOS to reduce its impact on the environment. The volume release or use of TRI reportable chemicals and/or the generation of hazardous wastes at the KOS facility will be dependent on the industry demand and necessary production, which fluctuates annually. Therefore, it is difficult to measure or project specific reductions. As described earlier, the generation of all Class I and hazardous wastes or, at a minimum for those wastes that must be generated, have them recycled where feasible.

Tipp City "First Pass Right" Quality Initiative.  As one might expect, the downturn in economy has not been kind to the DAP Tipp City Facility.  The DAP Tipp City Facility has been exploring methods for pollution reduction in its operations.  One of our success stories is the facility's "First Pass Right" Program. This is a program where the facility endeavors to make batches correctly the first time.  If we make batches correctly the first time, then the facility optimizes the use of A.  Raw materials (air, solid waste and hazardous waste pollution is minimized if the batch is correct on the first trial).  B.  Energy (used to drive the facilities equipment and processes is minimized if the batch is correct on the first trial).  Due to the hard work of our associates, the DAP Tipp City Facility was able to raise its first time right percentage from 76.4% in CY 2010 to 79.8% in CY 2011.  Process Enhancements - The DAP Tipp City Facility has purchased tooling and implemented procedures that allow the facilities 4-stem cartridge filler to completely empty the tanks supplying the 4-stem cartridge filler.  This prevents what previously waste in the bottom of the mixing tank from being thrown away.  Once again, due to the hard work of our associates, the facility has increased its packaging yield in its 10 oz. cartridge packaging operation.	NO	PDEVLIN@DAP.COM	RR5		NO

The cause of one release was a combination of high temperature and a faulty valve and/or gasket on a recovery tank, resulting in the purchase of 6,000 pounds of new HCFC-22 to replace the released HCFC-22 which had been recovered from equipment in preparation for repairs. In addition, contaminated HCFC-22 from another piece of equipment was sent off-site for recycling resulting in the use of 3,500 pounds of new HCFC-22 to clean and replace the HCFC-22 that was contaminated.  In this case there was no release to the environment, the entire contents of the chiller and recovery tank were sent off-site for recycling. Under normal operating conditions we would expect to use no more than 500 pounds of HCFC-22 to recharge each chiller resulting in an annual usage of about 3,000 pounds per year.  When a leak is discovered that cannot be quickly repaired, the chiller is evacuated to a recovery tank and the recovered HCFC-22 is reused. This year we had two abnormal events that caused us to exceed our activity threshold for this chemical.

We report zero transfers tothe City of Portland Wastewater Treatment, since we treat all chemicals on-site, per our City of Portland Wastewater permit.

After consultation with the EPA, we determined that these were actually sales of product, and not off-site disposal of waste.  We manufacture chemicals to very low tolerances for contamination for the semiconductor industry.  The chemical we declared in 2008 was actually sold as "tech-grade" chemical after the satallite testing facility at the semiconductor customer's site determined that the contamination level was too high to use in semiconductor facilities (parts per billion contamination).  We resold this chemical as "tech-grade" to another customer, as it still met their specs for use.	NO	KHAMAR@KANTOCORP.COM			NO

This is a program where the facility endeavors to make batches correctly the first time.  If we make batches correctly the first time, then the facility optimizes the use of A.  Raw materials (air, solid waste and hazardous waste pollution is minimized if the batch is correct on the first trial).  B.  Energy (used to drive the facilities equipment and processes is minimized if the batch is correct on the first trial).  Due to the hard work of our associates, the DAP Tipp City Facility was able to raise its first time right percentage from 76.4% in CY 2010 to 79.8% in CY 2011.  Process Enhancements - The DAP Tipp City Facility has purchased tooling and implemented procedures that allow the facilities 4-stem cartridge filler to completely empty the tanks supplying the 4-stem cartridge filler.  This prevents what previously waste in the bottom of the mixing tank from being thrown away.  Once again, due to the hard work of our associates, the facility has increased its packaging yield in its 10 oz. cartridge packaging operation.	NO	PDEVLIN@DAP.COM	RR5		NO

The reason for the reduction is that this operation was discontinued early in the year for most of the rest of the year.  Hygenic maintains all of the equipment for this product line and may continue to process products on this line but on much reduced time.  This product line had run every week throughout the year prior to this report.  It ran every week for the first quarter of this reporting year.  In following years it is expected that it may run only 0 - 2 weeks throughout the entire year.  This is not related to any source reduction method.  Reductions are expected to be much smaller in subsequent years.  Primary operations for this product line have been removed from this facility.    320 lbs. was reported for fugitive air emissions and stack emissions combined which is virtually unchanged from previous years because the source is from a different manufacturing process which has similar productivity relative to the previous reporting year.

After the installation of equipment was complete, the operation first began in December, 2010, and it continued throughout 2011.  Much of the fiber that was once disposed of in the facility's landfill is now reclaimed, and the fiber is able to return into the mill's process or into another facility's process for manufacturing paper.  The fiber sludge that is now disposed of in the landfill is solely deposited there to be used as an alternative cover for dirt, aiding in covering wastes to meet landfill regulations.  In essence, the facility is now able to reduce the toxins being disposed of to the landfill via sludge while maintaining the same paper manufacturing productivity.	NO	AWINTERS@GBP.COM			NO

The manufacturer of the distillation units claimed the units would recycle the stoddard solvent in the tanks in 4 to 8 hours.  The distilled residue would then be accumulated for proper disposal.  The units never performed as advertised.  Stp is investigating the purchase or lease of a larger stand alone distillation unit to help reduce the usage of stoddard solvent.  This project will continue to be investigated in 2011.  If implemented, this would result in off-Site disposal of still bottoms containing metals versus drums of spent stoddard solvent containing metals.  In 2011, stp did not implement on-Site solvent distillation.  In 2012, stp will continue to investigate on-Site solvent distillation in 2012, stp is investigating the possibility of managing spent solvent as a hazardous secondary material.

After the installation of equipment was complete, the operation first began in December, 2010, and it continued throughout 2011.  Much of the fiber that was once disposed of in the facility's landfill is now reclaimed, and the fiber is able to return into the mill's process or into another facility's process for manufacturing paper.  The fiber sludge that is now disposed of in the landfill is solely deposited there to be used as an alternative cover for dirt, aiding in covering wastes to meet landfill regulations.  In essence, the facility is now able to reduce the toxins being disposed of to the landfill via sludge while maintaining the same paper manufacturing productivity.	NO	AWINTERS@GBP.COM			NO

A brief discussion of 2011 activities is as follows:   1) Annual preventative maintenance (PM).  The units were shutdown for comprehensive PM, in accordance with manufacturer recommendations.  2) Adjusted the production paint schedule and the crew now predominantly work 4 days,10 hour shifts with no paint activity on day 5. This schedule results in less start-up and shut-downs and less production irregularities.  3) In January 2011, full ductwork maintenance of the capture system was conducted with very thorough cleaning. 4) Iimplemented a new type of paint that requires less coating thickness which lead to a usage reduction for the same area painted for one specific product line and will continue to roll-out this coating to other product lines. 5) Exteria Building Products is also investigating to move certain automated spray applications to a manual operation. An operator can specifically spray certain stone details. Whereas an automated spray-booth applies a wide-area coverage and lays paint not only on the finished product but also on a mask that does not need to be painted. Going to a manual operation can yield up to 80% paint and thus source reduction for one specific product line.	NO	MHODGE@DERBYBP.COM			NO

(KOS) facility began its construction in July 2001 in Ingleside, Texas. Based on industry knowledge, waste minimization, disposal, and recycling practices were identified and implemented from the inception of the facility. It is the goal of KOS to reduce the generation of all Class I and hazardous wastes or, at a minimum for those wastes that must be generated, have them recycled where feasible. These chemicals, for the most part, become part of the manufactured article, but are not considered exempt for reporting purposes. When available, KOS attempts to educate the client in non-waste generating manufacturing procedures and constituents as alternatives to the initial product specification.  KOS will continue to pursue the identification of products and chemicals used in its primary activities to allow the client and KOS to reduce its impact on the environment. The volume release or use of TRI reportable chemicals and/or the generation of hazardous wastes at the KOS facility will be dependent on the industry demand and necessary production, which fluctuates annually. Therefore, it is difficult to measure or project specific reductions. As described earlier, the generation of all Class I and hazardous wastes or, at a minimum for those wastes that must be generated, have them recycled where feasible.

These chemicals, for the most part, become part of the manufactured article, but are not considered exempt for reporting purposes.

The DAP Tipp City Facility has been exploring methods for pollution reduction in its operations.  One of our success stories is the facility's "First Pass Right" Program. This is a program where the facility endeavors to make batches correctly the first time.  If we make batches correctly the first time, then the facility optimizes the use of A.  Raw materials (air, solid waste and hazardous waste pollution is minimized if the batch is correct on the first trial).  B.  Energy (used to drive the facilities equipment and processes is minimized if the batch is correct on the first trial).  Due to the hard work of our associates, the DAP Tipp City Facility was able to raise its first time right percentage from 76.4% in CY 2010 to 79.8% in CY 2011 Process Enhancements - The DAP Tipp City Facility has purchased tooling and implemented procedures that allow the facilities 4-stem cartridge filler to completely empty the tanks supplying the 4-stem cartridge filler.  This prevents what previously waste in the bottom of the mixing tank from being thrown away.  Once again, due to the hard work of our associates, the facility has increased its packaging yield in its 10 oz. cartridge packaging operation.	NO	PDEVLIN@DAP.COM	RR5		NO

Tipp City "First Pass Right" Quality Initiative.  As one might expect, the downturn in economy has not been kind to the DAP Tipp City Facility.  The DAP Tipp City Facility has been exploring methods for pollution reduction in its operations.  One of our success stories is the facility's "First Pass Right" Program. This is a program where the facility endeavors to make batches correctly the first time.  If we make batches correctly the first time, then the facility optimizes the use of A.  Raw materials (air, solid waste and hazardous waste pollution is minimized if the batch is correct on the first trial).  B.  Energy (used to drive the facilities equipment and processes is minimized if the batch is correct on the first trial).  Due to the hard work of our associates, the DAP Tipp City Facility was able to raise its first time right percentage from 76.4% in CY 2010 to 79.8% in CY 2011  Process Enhancements - The DAP Tipp City Facility has purchased tooling and implemented procedures that allow the facilities 4-stem cartridge filler to completely empty the tanks supplying the 4-stem cartridge filler.  This prevents what previously waste in the bottom of the mixing tank from being thrown away.  Once again, due to the hard work of our associates, the facility has increased its packaging yield in its 10 oz. cartridge packaging operation.	NO	PDEVLIN@DAP.COM	RR5		NO

The high grade zinc has less lead as a component than the prime western zinc.  Due to the economic challenges and the loss of some employees it was difficult to maintain high product quality while using the high grade zinc.  Consequently, the decision was made to go back to the prime western zinc to keep the quality of the galvanizing high.

Our goal is to continuously test new gel-coat and resin materials, as they become available.  We have primarily focused on low-VOC input materials as a method to reduce emissions.  In recent years we have moved to low-HAPS gel coats. We anticipate the future will see lower HAPS in all products we use.   We continue to minimize waste due to over-mixing of resin batches or defective final products.  The amount of resin and filler needed for each series of molds is well established and is conveyed effectively to our employees.  This results in very little excess preparation of the resin/filler mixture.  Likewise, our continued attention to quality has resulted in a very small number of defective final products.  The importance of reducing these sources of product waste is well understood by production supervisors and employees, and is fully integrated into our total quality management system.  We will also continue to search for a method of applying the gel coat that will effectively coat the mold while reducing the amount of overspray.  After careful consideration, we have determined that automating this spray coating operation would not result in less overspray than application by a well-trained employee.

(KOS) facility began its construction in July 2001 in Ingleside, Texas. Based on industry knowledge, waste minimization, disposal, and recycling practices were identified and implemented from the inception of the facility. It is the goal of KOS to reduce the generation of all Class I and hazardous wastes or, at a minimum for those wastes that must be generated, have them recycled where feasible. These chemicals, for the most part, become part of the manufactured article, but are not considered exempt for reporting purposes. When available, KOS attempts to educate the client in non-waste generating manufacturing procedures and constituents as alternatives to the initial product specification.  KOS will continue to pursue the identification of products and chemicals used in its primary activities to allow the client and KOS to reduce its impact on the environment. The volume release or use of TRI reportable chemicals and/or the generation of hazardous wastes at the KOS facility will be dependent on the industry demand and necessary production, which fluctuates annually. Therefore, it is difficult to measure or project specific reductions.

(KOS) facility began its construction in July 2001 in Ingleside, Texas. Based on industry knowledge, waste minimization, disposal, and recycling practices were identified and implemented from the inception of the facility. It is the goal of KOS to reduce the generation of all Class I and hazardous wastes or, at a minimum for those wastes that must be generated, have them recycled where feasible. These chemicals, for the most part, become part of the manufactured article, but are not considered exempt for reporting purposes. When available, KOS attempts to educate the client in non-waste generating manufacturing procedures and constituents as alternatives to the initial product specification.  KOS will continue to pursue the identification of products and chemicals used in its primary activities to allow the client and KOS to reduce its impact on the environment. The volume release or use of TRI reportable chemicals and/or the generation of hazardous wastes at the KOS facility will be dependent on the industry demand and necessary production, which fluctuates annually. Therefore, it is difficult to measure or project specific reductions. As described earlier, the generation of all Class I and hazardous wastes or, at a minimum for those wastes that must be generated, have them recycled where feasible.

Tipp City "First Pass Right" Quality Initiative.  As one might expect, the downturn in economy has not been kind to the DAP Tipp City Facility.  The DAP Tipp City Facility has been exploring methods for pollution reduction in its operations.  One of our success stories is the facility's "First Pass Right" Program. This is a program where the facility endeavors to make batches correctly the first time.  If we make batches correctly the first time, then the facility optimizes the use of A.  Raw materials (air, solid waste and hazardous waste pollution is minimized if the batch is correct on the first trial).  B.  Energy (used to drive the facilities equipment and processes is minimized if the batch is correct on the first trial).  Due to the hard work of our associates, the DAP Tipp City Facility was able to raise its first time right percentage from 76.4% in CY 2010 to 79.8% in CY 2011  Process Enhancements - The DAP Tipp City Facility has purchased tooling and implemented procedures that allow the facilities 4-stem cartridge filler to completely empty the tanks supplying the 4-stem cartridge filler.  This prevents what previously waste in the bottom of the mixing tank from being thrown away.  Once again, due to the hard work of our associates, the facility has increased its packaging yield in its 10 oz. cartridge packaging operation.	NO	PDEVLIN@DAP.COM	RR5		NO

Much of the fiber that was once disposed of in the facility's landfill is now reclaimed, and the fiber is able to return into the mill's process or into another facility's process for manufacturing paper.  The fiber sludge that is now disposed of in the landfill is solely deposited there to be used as an alternative cover for dirt, aiding in covering wastes to meet landfill regulations.

A brief discussion of 2011 activities is as follows:   1) Annual preventative maintenance (PM).  The units were shutdown for comprehensive PM, in accordance with manufacturer recommendations.  2) Adjusted the production paint schedule and the crew now predominantly work 4 days,10 hour shifts with no paint activity on day 5. This schedule results in less start-up and shut-downs and less production irregularities.  3) In January 2011, full ductwork maintenance of the capture system was conducted with very thorough cleaning. 4) Iimplemented a new type of paint that requires less coating thickness which lead to a usage reduction for the same area painted for one specific product line and will continue to roll-out this coating to other product lines. 5) Exteria Building Products is also investigating to move certain automated spray applications to a manual operation. An operator can specifically spray certain stone details. Whereas an automated spray-booth applies a wide-area coverage and lays paint not only on the finished product but also on a mask that does not need to be painted. Going to a manual operation can yield up to 80% paint and thus source reduction for one specific product line.	NO	MHODGE@DERBYBP.COM			NO
