SINCE ONE VOLUME OF NITROGEN WEIGHS FOURTEEN TIMES AS MUCH AS ONE VOLUME OF HYDROGEN, ON A WEIGHT BASIS, THE RATIO IS FOURTEEN PARTS OF NITROGEN TO THREE PARTS OF HYDROGEN, OR ABOUT 82% NITROGEN AND 18 % HYDROGEN. AT ATMOSPHERIC TEMPERATURES AND PRESSURES, ANHYDROUS AMMONIA IS A PUNGENT COLORLESS GAS. ANHYDROUS AMMONIA BOILS AT -28°F (AT 1 ATM) AND FREEZES TO A WHITE CRYSTALLINE MASS AT -108°F. WHEN HEATED ABOVE ITS CRITICAL TEMPERATURE OF 271.4°F, AMMONIA EXIST ONLY AS A VAPOR REGARDLESS OF THE PRESSURE. BETWEEN THE MELTING AND CRITICAL POINTS, LIQUID AMMONIA EXERTS A VAPOR PRESSURE, WHICH INCREASES WITH RISING TEMPERATURE. WHEN LIQUID AMMONIA IS IN A CLOSED CONTAINER IT IS IN EQUILIBRIUM WITH AMMONIA VAPOR AND THE PRESSURE WITHIN THE CONTAINER BEARS A DEFINITE RELATIONSHIP TO THE TEMPERATURE. ABOVE 900°F, AMMONIA BEGINS TO DECOMPOSE, REVERTING TO HYDROGEN AND NITROGEN. THE PROCESS AT WOODWORTH INC., INVOLVES AMMONIA BEING INTRODUCED INTO THE FURNACES AS A VAPOR. THE NITROGEN IS DIFFUSED INTO THE SURFACE LAYER OF THE METAL AND THE HYDROGEN IS EXHAUSTED TO THE FURNACE BURN-OFF STACK, WHERE IT IS MIXED WITH NATURAL GAS AND IT IS IGNITED BY A PYROTECHNIC DEVICE TO INSURE COMPLETE COMBUSTION.
