IN DECEMBER 2009 EASTMAN ISSUED A NEWS RELEASE OF THEIR DECISION TO TERMINATE BUSINESS OPPORTUNITIES AT THE BEAUMONT FACILITY.

(2) ALSO, DURING CALENDAR YEAR 2011, A REMEDIATION PROJECT WAS IMPLEMENTED AT THE FIRING RANGE WHICH GENERATED A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF LEAD WASTE THAT SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASED THE LEAD RELEASE QUANTITIES AT PANTEX.  THE OUTDOOR PORTION OF THE FIRING RANGE AT THE PANTEX PLANT IS USED BY SECURITY PERSONNEL FOR FIREARMS PRACTICE AND TRAINING.  THE FIRING RANGE HAS SEVERAL EARTHEN BERMS THAT BULLETS ARE FIRED INTO DURING TRAINING EXERCISES.  THESE BERMS ARE COVERED WITH A LAYER OF DOLOMITE, AND MOST OF THE LEAD BULLETS ARE CAPTURED IN THE DOLOMITE LAYER.  AFTER A PERIOD OF 10 TO 15 YEARS, THE DOLOMITE BECOMES SATURATED WITH LEAD BULLETS AND MUST BE REPLACED.  THE REPLACEMENT IS NECESSARY BECAUSE BULLETS CAN RICOCHET FROM THE SATURATED DOLOMITE, CAUSING A SAFETY HAZARD TO SECURITY PERSONNEL.    NORMALLY, THE LEAD-CONTAMINATED DOLOMITE WOULD BE COMPLETELY REMOVED AND DISPOSED OF AS HAZARDOUS WASTE AND THEN NEW DOLOMITE WOULD BE PURCHASED AND APPLIED TO THE BERMS TO REPLACE THE REMOVED MATERIAL.  FOR THIS PROJECT, PANTEX PERSONNEL WERE DETERMINED TO FIND A WAY TO RECYCLE THE LARGE QUANTITY OF MATERIAL TO BE REMOVED FROM THE BERMS.  A CONTRACTOR WAS LOCATED WITH CAPABILITIES TO FILTER AND CLEAN THE DOLOMITE SO THAT A MAJORITY OF THE MATERIAL COULD BE RECOVERED AND REAPPLIED TO THE BERMS.  THIS APPROACH PROVED TO BE VERY SUCCESSFUL BOTH IN REDUCING COSTS AND THE QUANTITY OF HAZARDOUS WASTE GENERATED.   REPLACEMENT OF THE DOLOMITE WITHOUT RECYCLING WOULD HAVE RESULTED IN THE GENERATION OF 1,440 TONS OF HAZARDOUS WASTE.  BY IMPLEMENTING THIS RECYCLING PROJECT TO FILTER AND REUSE THE MAJORITY OF THE DOLOMITE, ONLY 24 TONS OF WASTE WERE GENERATED AND DISPOSED.  THIS REPRESENTS A 98% REDUCTION IN HAZARDOUS WASTE AND A CORRESPONDING COST SAVINGS OF $422,800 IN REDUCED SHIPPING AND DISPOSAL COSTS.  BY REUSING THE FILTERED DOLOMITE, PANTEX ALSO AVOIDED PURCHASING APPROXIMATELY 1,500 TONS OF NEW DOLOMITE FOR AN ADDITIONAL COST SAVINGS OF $28,365.  BY TAKING THE INITIATIVE FOR SUSTAINABILITY AND COST EFFECTIVENESS, THE PANTEX TEAM INVOLVED WITH THIS PROJECT WAS SUCCESSFUL IN KEEPING 1,416 TONS OF HAZARDOUS WASTE OUT OF A LANDFILL WHILE REDUCING COSTS BY MORE THAN $450,000.
