THE DAP TIPP CITY FACILITY HAS BEEN EXPLORING METHODS FOR POLLUTION REDUCTION IN ITS OPERATIONS.  ONE OF OUR SUCCESS STORIES IS THE FACILITY'S "FIRST PASS RIGHT" PROGRAM. THIS IS A PROGRAM WHERE THE FACILITY ENDEAVORS TO MAKE BATCHES CORRECTLY THE FIRST TIME.  IF WE MAKE BATCHES CORRECTLY THE FIRST TIME, THEN THE FACILITY OPTIMIZES THE USE OF A.  RAW MATERIALS (AIR, SOLID WASTE AND HAZARDOUS WASTE POLLUTION IS MINIMIZED IF THE BATCH IS CORRECT ON THE FIRST TRIAL).  B.  ENERGY (USED TO DRIVE THE FACILITIES EQUIPMENT AND PROCESSES IS MINIMIZED IF THE BATCH IS CORRECT ON THE FIRST TRIAL).  DUE TO THE HARD WORK OF OUR ASSOCIATES, THE DAP TIPP CITY FACILITY WAS ABLE TO RAISE ITS FIRST TIME RIGHT PERCENTAGE FROM 76.4% IN CY 2010 TO 79.8% IN CY 2011.  PROCESS ENHANCEMENTS - THE DAP TIPP CITY FACILITY HAS PURCHASED TOOLING AND IMPLEMENTED PROCEDURES THAT ALLOW THE FACILITIES 4-STEM CARTRIDGE FILLER TO COMPLETELY EMPTY THE TANKS SUPPLYING THE 4-STEM CARTRIDGE FILLER.  THIS PREVENTS WHAT PREVIOUSLY WASTE IN THE BOTTOM OF THE MIXING TANK FROM BEING THROWN AWAY.

TIPP CITY "FIRST PASS RIGHT" QUALITY INITIATIVE.  AS ONE MIGHT EXPECT, THE DOWNTURN IN ECONOMY HAS NOT BEEN KIND TO THE DAP TIPP CITY FACILITY.  THE DAP TIPP CITY FACILITY HAS BEEN EXPLORING METHODS FOR POLLUTION REDUCTION IN ITS OPERATIONS.  ONE OF OUR SUCCESS STORIES IS THE FACILITY'S "FIRST PASS RIGHT" PROGRAM. THIS IS A PROGRAM WHERE THE FACILITY ENDEAVORS TO MAKE BATCHES CORRECTLY THE FIRST TIME.  IF WE MAKE BATCHES CORRECTLY THE FIRST TIME, THEN THE FACILITY OPTIMIZES THE USE OF A.  RAW MATERIALS (AIR, SOLID WASTE AND HAZARDOUS WASTE POLLUTION IS MINIMIZED IF THE BATCH IS CORRECT ON THE FIRST TRIAL).  B.  ENERGY (USED TO DRIVE THE FACILITIES EQUIPMENT AND PROCESSES IS MINIMIZED IF THE BATCH IS CORRECT ON THE FIRST TRIAL). DUE TO THE HARD WORK OF OUR ASSOCIATES, THE DAP TIPP CITY FACILITY WAS ABLE TO RAISE ITS FIRST TIME RIGHT PERCENTAGE FROM 76.4% IN CY 2010 TO 79.8% IN CY 2011  PROCESS ENHANCEMENTS - THE DAP TIPP CITY FACILITY HAS PURCHASED TOOLING AND IMPLEMENTED PROCEDURES THAT ALLOW THE FACILITIES 4-STEM CARTRIDGE FILLER TO COMPLETELY EMPTY THE TANKS SUPPLYING THE 4-STEM CARTRIDGE FILLER.  THIS PREVENTS WHAT PREVIOUSLY WASTE IN THE BOTTOM OF THE MIXING TANK FROM BEING THROWN AWAY.  ONCE AGAIN, DUE TO THE HARD WORK OF OUR ASSOCIATES, THE FACILITY HAS INCREASED ITS PACKAGING YIELD IN ITS 10 OZ. CARTRIDGE PACKAGING OPERATION.	NO	TDEVAULT@DAP.COM			NO

TIPP CITY "FIRST PASS RIGHT" QUALITY INITIATIVE.  AS ONE MIGHT EXPECT, THE DOWNTURN IN ECONOMY HAS NOT BEEN KIND TO THE DAP TIPP CITY FACILITY.  THE DAP TIPP CITY FACILITY HAS BEEN EXPLORING METHODS FOR POLLUTION REDUCTION IN ITS OPERATIONS.  ONE OF OUR SUCCESS STORIES IS THE FACILITY'S "FIRST PASS RIGHT" PROGRAM. THIS IS A PROGRAM WHERE THE FACILITY ENDEAVORS TO MAKE BATCHES CORRECTLY THE FIRST TIME.  IF WE MAKE BATCHES CORRECTLY THE FIRST TIME, THEN THE FACILITY OPTIMIZES THE USE OF A.  RAW MATERIALS (AIR, SOLID WASTE AND HAZARDOUS WASTE POLLUTION IS MINIMIZED IF THE BATCH IS CORRECT ON THE FIRST TRIAL).  B.  ENERGY (USED TO DRIVE THE FACILITIES EQUIPMENT AND PROCESSES IS MINIMIZED IF THE BATCH IS CORRECT ON THE FIRST TRIAL).  DUE TO THE HARD WORK OF OUR ASSOCIATES, THE DAP TIPP CITY FACILITY WAS ABLE TO RAISE ITS FIRST TIME RIGHT PERCENTAGE FROM 76.4% IN CY 2010 TO 79.8% IN CY 2011  PROCESS ENHANCEMENTS - THE DAP TIPP CITY FACILITY HAS PURCHASED TOOLING AND IMPLEMENTED PROCEDURES THAT ALLOW THE FACILITIES 4-STEM CARTRIDGE FILLER TO COMPLETELY EMPTY THE TANKS SUPPLYING THE 4-STEM CARTRIDGE FILLER.  THIS PREVENTS WHAT PREVIOUSLY WASTE IN THE BOTTOM OF THE MIXING TANK FROM BEING THROWN AWAY.  ONCE AGAIN, DUE TO THE HARD WORK OF OUR ASSOCIATES, THE FACILITY HAS INCREASED ITS PACKAGING YIELD IN ITS 10 OZ. CARTRIDGE PACKAGING OPERATION.	NO	TDEVAULT@DAP.COM			NO

THE REASON FOR THE REDUCTION IS THAT THIS OPERATION WAS DISCONTINUED EARLY IN THE YEAR FOR MOST OF THE REST OF THE YEAR.  HYGENIC MAINTAINS ALL OF THE EQUIPMENT FOR THIS PRODUCT LINE AND MAY CONTINUE TO PROCESS PRODUCTS ON THIS LINE BUT ON MUCH REDUCED TIME.  THIS PRODUCT LINE HAD RUN EVERY WEEK THROUGHOUT THE YEAR PRIOR TO THIS REPORT.  IT RAN EVERY WEEK FOR THE FIRST QUARTER OF THIS REPORTING YEAR.  IN FOLLOWING YEARS IT IS EXPECTED THAT IT MAY RUN ONLY 0 - 2 WEEKS THROUGHOUT THE ENTIRE YEAR.  THIS IS NOT RELATED TO ANY SOURCE REDUCTION METHOD.  REDUCTIONS ARE EXPECTED TO BE MUCH SMALLER IN SUBSEQUENT YEARS.  PRIMARY OPERATIONS FOR THIS PRODUCT LINE HAVE BEEN REMOVED FROM THIS FACILITY.    320 LBS. WAS REPORTED FOR FUGITIVE AIR EMISSIONS AND STACK EMISSIONS COMBINED WHICH IS VIRTUALLY UNCHANGED FROM PREVIOUS YEARS BECAUSE THE SOURCE IS FROM A DIFFERENT MANUFACTURING PROCESS WHICH HAS SIMILAR PRODUCTIVITY RELATIVE TO THE PREVIOUS REPORTING YEAR.
