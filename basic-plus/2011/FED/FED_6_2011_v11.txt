(2) ALSO, DURING CALENDAR YEAR 2011, A REMEDIATION PROJECT WAS IMPLEMENTED AT THE FIRING RANGE WHICH GENERATED A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF LEAD WASTE THAT SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASED THE LEAD RELEASE QUANTITIES AT PANTEX.  THE OUTDOOR PORTION OF THE FIRING RANGE AT THE PANTEX PLANT IS USED BY SECURITY PERSONNEL FOR FIREARMS PRACTICE AND TRAINING.  THE FIRING RANGE HAS SEVERAL EARTHEN BERMS THAT BULLETS ARE FIRED INTO DURING TRAINING EXERCISES.  THESE BERMS ARE COVERED WITH A LAYER OF DOLOMITE, AND MOST OF THE LEAD BULLETS ARE CAPTURED IN THE DOLOMITE LAYER.  AFTER A PERIOD OF 10 TO 15 YEARS, THE DOLOMITE BECOMES SATURATED WITH LEAD BULLETS AND MUST BE REPLACED.  THE REPLACEMENT IS NECESSARY BECAUSE BULLETS CAN RICOCHET FROM THE SATURATED DOLOMITE, CAUSING A SAFETY HAZARD TO SECURITY PERSONNEL.    NORMALLY, THE LEAD-CONTAMINATED DOLOMITE WOULD BE COMPLETELY REMOVED AND DISPOSED OF AS HAZARDOUS WASTE AND THEN NEW DOLOMITE WOULD BE PURCHASED AND APPLIED TO THE BERMS TO REPLACE THE REMOVED MATERIAL.  FOR THIS PROJECT, PANTEX PERSONNEL WERE DETERMINED TO FIND A WAY TO RECYCLE THE LARGE QUANTITY OF MATERIAL TO BE REMOVED FROM THE BERMS.  A CONTRACTOR WAS LOCATED WITH CAPABILITIES TO FILTER AND CLEAN THE DOLOMITE SO THAT A MAJORITY OF THE MATERIAL COULD BE RECOVERED AND REAPPLIED TO THE BERMS.  THIS APPROACH PROVED TO BE VERY SUCCESSFUL BOTH IN REDUCING COSTS AND THE QUANTITY OF HAZARDOUS WASTE GENERATED.   REPLACEMENT OF THE DOLOMITE WITHOUT RECYCLING WOULD HAVE RESULTED IN THE GENERATION OF 1,440 TONS OF HAZARDOUS WASTE.  BY IMPLEMENTING THIS RECYCLING PROJECT TO FILTER AND REUSE THE MAJORITY OF THE DOLOMITE, ONLY 24 TONS OF WASTE WERE GENERATED AND DISPOSED.  THIS REPRESENTS A 98% REDUCTION IN HAZARDOUS WASTE AND A CORRESPONDING COST SAVINGS OF $422,800 IN REDUCED SHIPPING AND DISPOSAL COSTS.  BY REUSING THE FILTERED DOLOMITE, PANTEX ALSO AVOIDED PURCHASING APPROXIMATELY 1,500 TONS OF NEW DOLOMITE FOR AN ADDITIONAL COST SAVINGS OF $28,365.  BY TAKING THE INITIATIVE FOR SUSTAINABILITY AND COST EFFECTIVENESS, THE PANTEX TEAM INVOLVED WITH THIS PROJECT WAS SUCCESSFUL IN KEEPING 1,416 TONS OF HAZARDOUS WASTE OUT OF A LANDFILL WHILE REDUCING COSTS BY MORE THAN $450,000.

THE CAUSE OF ONE RELEASE WAS A COMBINATION OF HIGH TEMPERATURE AND A FAULTY VALVE AND/OR GASKET ON A RECOVERY TANK, RESULTING IN THE PURCHASE OF 6,000 POUNDS OF NEW HCFC-22 TO REPLACE THE RELEASED HCFC-22 WHICH HAD BEEN RECOVERED FROM EQUIPMENT IN PREPARATION FOR REPAIRS. IN ADDITION, CONTAMINATED HCFC-22 FROM ANOTHER PIECE OF EQUIPMENT WAS SENT OFF-SITE FOR RECYCLING RESULTING IN THE USE OF 3,500 POUNDS OF NEW HCFC-22 TO CLEAN AND REPLACE THE HCFC-22 THAT WAS CONTAMINATED.  IN THIS CASE THERE WAS NO RELEASE TO THE ENVIRONMENT, THE ENTIRE CONTENTS OF THE CHILLER AND RECOVERY TANK WERE SENT OFF-SITE FOR RECYCLING. UNDER NORMAL OPERATING CONDITIONS WE WOULD EXPECT TO USE NO MORE THAN 500 POUNDS OF HCFC-22 TO RECHARGE EACH CHILLER RESULTING IN AN ANNUAL USAGE OF ABOUT 3,000 POUNDS PER YEAR.

THIS HAS WORKED VERY WELL IN REDUCING LEAD CONCENTRATIONS ON THE PAD, WHICH IN TURN MINIMIZES THE LEAD CONCENTRATIONS IN THE STORMWATER RUNOFF. REGARDLESS, PERIODIC MONITORING HAS SHOWN VERY SLIGHT TRACES OF PARTICULATE LEAD AND DISSOLVED LEAD IN THE STORMWATER RUNOFF FROM THE CONCRETE PAD. HENCE THE CHANGE IN DISCHARGES TO WATER BODIES FROM "NA" TO "1 TO 10 LBS". IN REVIEWING 2010 TRI DATA, A MISCALCULATION WAS DISCOVERED. THE FUGITIVE AIR EMISSIONS FOR 2010 SHOULD HAVE BEEN 5.1805 LBS VERSUS 4.1472 LBS. INSTEAD OF AN INCREASE FROM 2010 TO 2011 AS THE REPORT IS SHOWING, THERE SHOULD HAVE BEEN A DECREASE OF 4%. NORMALLY, THE BASE SENDS OUT 2 SHIPMENTS OF LEAD TO BE RECYCLED. DURING 2011, ONLY 1 SHIPMENT WENT OUT, BUT ON 1/12/12 A SHIPMENT WENT BUT THAT WILL BE COUNTED FOR 2012. BECAUSE OF THE TIMING OF OUR SHIPMENTS, IT SHOWS A DECREASE OF 74.2% IN OUR RECYCLING. I EXPECT 2012'S RECYCLING AMOUNT TO BE MUCH HIGHER. THE WASTE TRANSFERRED OFFSITE DOUBLED BECAUSE WOOD SUPPORT STRUCTURES AT THE FIRING RANGE CONTAINING LEAD HAD TO BE REPLACED.

THE SMALL ARMS RANGE IS LOCATED INDOORS AND IS EQUIPPED WITH BULLET TRAPS AND POLLUTION CONTROL DEVICES FOR THE BUILDING'S EXHAUST VENTILATION.  THE OB/OD SITE IS A SMALL EMERGENCY AND TRAINING SITE WITH A BURN PAN.
