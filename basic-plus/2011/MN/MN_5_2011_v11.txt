OUR GOAL IS TO CONTINUOUSLY TEST NEW GEL-COAT AND RESIN MATERIALS, AS THEY BECOME AVAILABLE.  WE HAVE PRIMARILY FOCUSED ON LOW-VOC INPUT MATERIALS AS A METHOD TO REDUCE EMISSIONS.  IN RECENT YEARS WE HAVE MOVED TO LOW-HAPS GEL COATS. WE ANTICIPATE THE FUTURE WILL SEE LOWER HAPS IN ALL PRODUCTS WE USE.   WE CONTINUE TO MINIMIZE WASTE DUE TO OVER-MIXING OF RESIN BATCHES OR DEFECTIVE FINAL PRODUCTS.  THE AMOUNT OF RESIN AND FILLER NEEDED FOR EACH SERIES OF MOLDS IS WELL ESTABLISHED AND IS CONVEYED EFFECTIVELY TO OUR EMPLOYEES.  THIS RESULTS IN VERY LITTLE EXCESS PREPARATION OF THE RESIN/FILLER MIXTURE.  LIKEWISE, OUR CONTINUED ATTENTION TO QUALITY HAS RESULTED IN A VERY SMALL NUMBER OF DEFECTIVE FINAL PRODUCTS.  THE IMPORTANCE OF REDUCING THESE SOURCES OF PRODUCT WASTE IS WELL UNDERSTOOD BY PRODUCTION SUPERVISORS AND EMPLOYEES, AND IS FULLY INTEGRATED INTO OUR TOTAL QUALITY MANAGEMENT SYSTEM.  WE WILL ALSO CONTINUE TO SEARCH FOR A METHOD OF APPLYING THE GEL COAT THAT WILL EFFECTIVELY COAT THE MOLD WHILE REDUCING THE AMOUNT OF OVERSPRAY.  AFTER CAREFUL CONSIDERATION, WE HAVE DETERMINED THAT AUTOMATING THIS SPRAY COATING OPERATION WOULD NOT RESULT IN LESS OVERSPRAY THAN APPLICATION BY A WELL-TRAINED EMPLOYEE.
