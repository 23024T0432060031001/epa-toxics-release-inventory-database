Ford Motor Company also issues an annual Sustainability Report, which follows the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) Guidelines for sustainability reporting. Ford is committed to pollution prevention. All manufacturing facilities worldwide have been third-party certified to the ISO 14001 standard.Ford Motor Company has implemented a minimum quantity lubricant (MQL) machining process (also called near-dry machining) that reduces waste by more than 80 percent for each engine we produce, also saving oil and water. This "dry-machining" process lubricates cutting tools with a fine spray of oil, rather than the conventional "wet-machining" that required large amounts of metal-working fluids and water to cool and lubricate the tools. For a typical production line, MQL can save more than 280,000 gallons of water per year. Additionally, MQL reduces the amount of oil needed to machine an engine or transmission by 80 percent or more.  And by avoiding the need for a coolant system across most engine production lines, MQL helps to reduce energy use. MQL also improves plant air quality by eliminating the airborne mist produced by traditional wet-machining.	NO	ABERKOWI@FORD.COM			YES

The Company has committed to the International Chamber of Commerce "Principles for Environmental Management" and is a member of the World Business Council for Sustainable Development (WBCSD) and the Coalition for Environmentally Responsible Economies (CERES). Ford Motor Company also issues an annual Sustainability Report, which follows the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) Guidelines for sustainability reporting. Ford is committed to pollution prevention. All manufacturing facilities worldwide have been third-party certified to the ISO 14001 standard.Ford Motor Company has implemented a minimum quantity lubricant (MQL) machining process (also called near-dry machining) that reduces waste by more than 80 percent for each engine we produce, also saving oil and water. This "dry-machining" process lubricates cutting tools with a fine spray of oil, rather than the conventional "wet-machining" that required large amounts of metal-working fluids and water to cool and lubricate the tools. For a typical production line, MQL can save more than 280,000 gallons of water per year. Additionally, MQL reduces the amount of oil needed to machine an engine or transmission by 80 percent or more.  And by avoiding the need for a coolant system across most engine production lines, MQL helps to reduce energy use. MQL also improves plant air quality by eliminating the airborne mist produced by traditional wet-machining.	NO	MSCHULHO@FORD.COM			YES

All manufacturing facilities worldwide have been third-party certified to the ISO 14001 standard.Ford Motor Company has implemented a minimum quantity lubricant (MQL) machining process (also called near-dry machining) that reduces waste by more than 80 percent for each engine we produce, also saving oil and water. This "dry-machining" process lubricates cutting tools with a fine spray of oil, rather than the conventional "wet-machining" that required large amounts of metal-working fluids and water to cool and lubricate the tools. For a typical production line, MQL can save more than 280,000 gallons of water per year. Additionally, MQL reduces the amount of oil needed to machine an engine or transmission by 80 percent or more.  And by avoiding the need for a coolant system across most engine production lines, MQL helps to reduce energy use. MQL also improves plant air quality by eliminating the airborne mist produced by traditional wet-machining.	NO	PEDDS@FORD.COM			YES

Ford Motor Company also issues an annual Sustainability Report, which follows the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) Guidelines for sustainability reporting. Ford is committed to pollution prevention. All manufacturing facilities worldwide have been third-party certified to the ISO 14001 standard.Ford Motor Company has implemented a minimum quantity lubricant (MQL) machining process (also called near-dry machining) that reduces waste by more than 80 percent for each engine we produce, also saving oil and water. This "dry-machining" process lubricates cutting tools with a fine spray of oil, rather than the conventional "wet-machining" that required large amounts of metal-working fluids and water to cool and lubricate the tools. For a typical production line, MQL can save more than 280,000 gallons of water per year. Additionally, MQL reduces the amount of oil needed to machine an engine or transmission by 80 percent or more.  And by avoiding the need for a coolant system across most engine production lines, MQL helps to reduce energy use. MQL also improves plant air quality by eliminating the airborne mist produced by traditional wet-machining.	NO	PEDDS@FORD.COM			YES

All manufacturing facilities worldwide have been third-party certified to the ISO 14001 standard.PTO:Ford Motor Company has implemented a minimum quantity lubricant (MQL) machining process (also called near-dry machining) that reduces waste by more than 80 percent for each engine we produce, also saving oil and water. This "dry-machining" process lubricates cutting tools with a fine spray of oil, rather than the conventional "wet-machining" that required large amounts of metal-working fluids and water to cool and lubricate the tools. For a typical production line, MQL can save more than 280,000 gallons of water per year. Additionally, MQL reduces the amount of oil needed to machine an engine or transmission by 80 percent or more.  And by avoiding the need for a coolant system across most engine production lines, MQL helps to reduce energy use. MQL also improves plant air quality by eliminating the airborne mist produced by traditional wet-machining.	NO	GTINSLEY@FORD.COM			YES

All manufacturing facilities worldwide have been third-party certified to the ISO 14001 standard.Ford Motor Company has implemented a minimum quantity lubricant (MQL) machining process (also called near-dry machining) that reduces waste by more than 80 percent for each engine we produce, also saving oil and water. This "dry-machining" process lubricates cutting tools with a fine spray of oil, rather than the conventional "wet-machining" that required large amounts of metal-working fluids and water to cool and lubricate the tools. For a typical production line, MQL can save more than 280,000 gallons of water per year. Additionally, MQL reduces the amount of oil needed to machine an engine or transmission by 80 percent or more.  And by avoiding the need for a coolant system across most engine production lines, MQL helps to reduce energy use. MQL also improves plant air quality by eliminating the airborne mist produced by traditional wet-machining.	NO				NO

And by avoiding the need for a coolant system across most engine production lines, MQL helps to reduce energy use. MQL also improves plant air quality by eliminating the airborne mist produced by traditional wet-machining.	NO				NO

This "dry-machining" process lubricates cutting tools with a fine spray of oil, rather than the conventional "wet-machining" that required large amounts of metal-working fluids and water to cool and lubricate the tools.

Additionally, MQL reduces the amount of oil needed to machine an engine or transmission by 80 percent or more.  And by avoiding the need for a coolant system across most engine production lines, MQL helps to reduce energy use. MQL also improves plant air quality by eliminating the airborne mist produced by traditional wet-machining.	NO	JBROW161@FORD.COM			YES

Training is given each year as to the safety operation and maintenance or our chlorine system and storage tank. The chemical in use (Chlorine) is used to sanitize water used in the processing of frozen vegetables. The quantity of chlorine used is in direct relation to the amount of vegetables available for processing. If processing vegetables pounds are up then chlorine usage will be up and just the opposite if the available vegetables pounds are down then chlorine usage will be down.

This "dry-machining" process lubricates cutting tools with a fine spray of oil, rather than the conventional "wet-machining" that required large amounts of metal-working fluids and water to cool and lubricate the tools. For a typical production line, MQL can save more than 280,000 gallons of water per year. Additionally, MQL reduces the amount of oil needed to machine an engine or transmission by 80 percent or more.  And by avoiding the need for a coolant system across most engine production lines, MQL helps to reduce energy use. MQL also improves plant air quality by eliminating the airborne mist produced by traditional wet-machining.	NO	PROGER25@FORD.COM			YES

This "dry-machining" process lubricates cutting tools with a fine spray of oil, rather than the conventional "wet-machining" that required large amounts of metal-working fluids and water to cool and lubricate the tools. For a typical production line, MQL can save more than 280,000 gallons of water per year. Additionally, MQL reduces the amount of oil needed to machine an engine or transmission by 80 percent or more.  And by avoiding the need for a coolant system across most engine production lines, MQL helps to reduce energy use.

This "dry-machining" process lubricates cutting tools with a fine spray of oil, rather than the conventional "wet-machining" that required large amounts of metal-working fluids and water to cool and lubricate the tools. For a typical production line, MQL can save more than 280,000 gallons of water per year. Additionally, MQL reduces the amount of oil needed to machine an engine or transmission by 80 percent or more.

Additionally, MQL reduces the amount of oil needed to machine an engine or transmission by 80 percent or more.

All manufacturing facilities worldwide have been third-party certified to the ISO 14001 standard.Ford Motor Company has implemented a minimum quantity lubricant (MQL) machining process (also called near-dry machining) that reduces waste by more than 80 percent for each engine we produce, also saving oil and water. This "dry-machining" process lubricates cutting tools with a fine spray of oil, rather than the conventional "wet-machining" that required large amounts of metal-working fluids and water to cool and lubricate the tools. For a typical production line, MQL can save more than 280,000 gallons of water per year. Additionally, MQL reduces the amount of oil needed to machine an engine or transmission by 80 percent or more.  And by avoiding the need for a coolant system across most engine production lines, MQL helps to reduce energy use. MQL also improves plant air quality by eliminating the airborne mist produced by traditional wet-machining.	NO	JWALKER6@FORD.COM			NO

This "dry-machining" process lubricates cutting tools with a fine spray of oil, rather than the conventional "wet-machining" that required large amounts of metal-working fluids and water to cool and lubricate the tools. For a typical production line, MQL can save more than 280,000 gallons of water per year. Additionally, MQL reduces the amount of oil needed to machine an engine or transmission by 80 percent or more.

This "dry-machining" process lubricates cutting tools with a fine spray of oil, rather than the conventional "wet-machining" that required large amounts of metal-working fluids and water to cool and lubricate the tools. For a typical production line, MQL can save more than 280,000 gallons of water per year. Additionally, MQL reduces the amount of oil needed to machine an engine or transmission by 80 percent or more.  And by avoiding the need for a coolant system across most engine production lines, MQL helps to reduce energy use. MQL also improves plant air quality by eliminating the airborne mist produced by traditional wet-machining.	NO	MSCHULHO@FORD.COM			YES
