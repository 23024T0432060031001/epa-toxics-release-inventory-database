It was discovered that we were over estimating the emissions for styrene.  Using the published emission factors and current production and use information we refined the emissions calculation to provide a more realistic calculation of styrene emissions.Another change in the reporting category of the styrene emissions is from a change in vendor.  We send our used drums that contain a resin residue in the bottom to a drum recycler for reconditioning and resale.  The off-site transfer of resin is a calculation of the % styrene in the resin residue in the bottom of the drums sent to the recycler.

This resulted in a better estimation of point source and fugutive emissions for ethylene glycol.  However, the reported increase in glycol emissions is due to a higher estimate of fugitive emissions from the piping systems.  These calculations assume the piping is filled 8,760 hrs. per year when in fact it is not.  But the recording keeping to determine when there is actual EG in the piping system is too onerous, so the emissions are over-inflated.  All EG at the facility is used in the process and does not generate any waste streams.	NO	MDIEHL@AOC-RESINS.COM			NO
