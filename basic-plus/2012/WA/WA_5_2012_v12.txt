The NBK Bangor facility contains two ranges that contribute to the lead contained in this report, a small arms range and a small Explosive Ordnance Disposal Open Burn/Open Detonation (OB/OD) site that is used for training and emergency disposal of munitions items that cannot be rendered inert and disposed of via traditional waste disposal methods.The Navy already employs an active pollution prevention program for the ranges designed to minimize releases at the sites.  The small arms range is indoors and enclosed and contains bullet traps to capture all spent bullets.  Addtionally, the ventilation for the building is routed through high effiiency dust collectors prior to exhausting to the outside air.  The OB/OD site employs a specially designed burn pan to minimize land releases of material to the environment as a result of OB/OD operations.  The Navy employs an active pollution prevention program with a dedicated staff member whose responsibility is to seek out and implement hazardous material and waste reduction efforts for NBK Bangor facility operations.  This program is implemented from the shop as well as management level and has been very successful in assisting with material and waste reduction efforts.  Significant recent pollution prevention activities include expansion of the Navy's Consolidated Hazardous Material Reutilization and Management Program (CHRIMP) to include more tenant activities as well as considerable research in the area of hazardous solvent usage reduction.|SRNA:This form is being submitted for Range Activities at NBK Bangor.
