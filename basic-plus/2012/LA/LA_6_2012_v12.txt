Per conversation with EPA hotline, a site organic wastestream sent to incineration contains trace copper compounds.  While the off-site incineration does not treat the copper compounds, ash from the incinerator, including the copper compounds, would ultimately be landfilled.  To resolve how to report this off-site transfer to a treatment facility, EPA hotline suggested to document the amount of copper compound in the organic waste sent to incineration by use the M94 "transfer to broker - disposal" code as the waste transfer did occur to the incinerator, however the site does not know where the incinerator ash, potentially contaiminated with the copper compounds, would be landfilled.

An EHS Management System is being develop and implemented to improve EHS management activities for OMNI.In 2012, OMNI substituted Exxsol D60 for Varsol, which contained Naphthalene as a component, in our formulations for 2-cycle motor oil.  This resulted in Naphthalene (CAS # 91-20-3)being below the Reporting Threshold for 2012.A Self Audit of the OMNI Specialty Packaging Environmental Program conducted in conjuction with the preparation of the 2012 TRI Form R found that Zinc Compound (N982) should have been reported on the 2010 TRI Form R and 2011 TRI Form R.
