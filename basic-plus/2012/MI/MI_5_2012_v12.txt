Since one volume of nitrogen weighs fourteen times as much as one volume of hydrogen, on a weight basis, the ratio is fourteen parts of nitrogen to three parts of hydrogen, or about 82% nitrogen and 18% hydrogen. At atmospheric temperatures and pressures, anhydrous ammonia is a pungent colorless gas. Anhydrous ammonia boils at -28ÿ¿ÿ¿ÿ¿ÿ¿ÿ¿ÿ¿ÿ¿ÿ¿ÿ¿ÿ¿ÿ¿ÿ¿ÿ¿ÿ¿ÿ¿ÿ¿ÿ¿ÿ¿ÿ¿ÿ¿ÿ¿ÿ¿ÿ¿ÿ¿ÿ¿ÿ¿ÿ¿ÿ¿ÿ¿ÿ¿ÿ¿ÿ°F (at 1atm) and freezes to a white crystalline mass at -108ÿ¿ÿ¿ÿ¿ÿ¿ÿ¿ÿ¿ÿ¿ÿ¿ÿ¿ÿ¿ÿ¿ÿ¿ÿ¿ÿ¿ÿ¿ÿ¿ÿ¿ÿ¿ÿ¿ÿ¿ÿ¿ÿ¿ÿ¿ÿ¿ÿ¿ÿ¿ÿ¿ÿ¿ÿ¿ÿ¿ÿ¿ÿ°F.

Between the melting and critical points, liquid ammonia exerts a vapor pressure, which increases with rising temperature. When liquid ammonia is in a solid container, it is in equilibrium with ammonia vapor and the pressure within the container bears a definite relationship to the temperature. Above 900ÿ¿ÿ¿ÿ¿ÿ¿ÿ¿ÿ¿ÿ¿ÿ¿ÿ¿ÿ¿ÿ¿ÿ¿ÿ¿ÿ¿ÿ¿ÿ°F, ammonia begins to decompose, reverting to hydrogen and nitrogen. The process at Woodworth Inc., involves ammonia being introduced into the furnaces as a vapor. The nitrogen is diffused into the surface layer of the metal and the hydrogen is exhausted to the furnace burn-off stack, where it is mixed with natural gas and it is ignited by a pyrotechnic device to insure complete combustion.

Insufficient capital.The facility uses ammonia in the carburizing process used to increase the hardness of axle gears.  The ammonia disassociates at 850 degrees whereas the furnace temperature is 1550 degrees.  The facility made a conservative estimate in the Air Discharge permit of a 95% destruction rate.  This percentage was used to estimate the amount of ammonia that was released; in reality the actual destruction efficiency is probably in the 99-100% range.  There would be a very large cost to install an after-burner to destruct such a small amount of ammonia.   Additionally the facility did not have the capital to perform stack testing to determine the exact destruction level that is achieved in the furnaces themselves.	NO	THOMAS.COLLINS@ZF.COM			NO
