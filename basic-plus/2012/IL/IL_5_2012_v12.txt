The Barium Sulfate (Filtrate) is sent to a Non-Hazardous Landfill.  The filtered wastewater is sent to the local POTW.

Our manufacturing equipment and maintenance programs have all been setup to minimize the lead waste. All lead waste streams that are generated are send off site for recycling. Our industry has been and is continuing it's journey in replacing leaded solders with lead-free solders. Since we are custom assembly manufacture, and we do not design the products we build, we must rely on our customers to design out the use of leaded solders. Many of our customers are medical, defense and aerospace, which currently have exemptions in the use of lead-free solders. These exemptions will be expired in the 12 - 24 months, so we anticipate our customers redesigning their products, using lead-free solders.
