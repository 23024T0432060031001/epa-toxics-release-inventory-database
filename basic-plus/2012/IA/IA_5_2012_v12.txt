This is as a result of calculating emissions differently.  Previsously, emissions were calculated using an emission factor for wire welding for the entire wire.  In fusing, only a small percentage of the wire used is melted, so the amount of wire was divided by 100 (assuming 1% of wire is actually fused, the rest is wrapped around the stator).  Thus, you will note a 99% decrease in reported emissions.	NO	RYANO@GROSCHOPP.COM			YES
