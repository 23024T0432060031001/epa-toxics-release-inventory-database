All zinc sludge was cleaned out and disposed of.  We anticipate that we will not need to perform this task in the upcoming years therefore zinc waste is anticipated to decrease back to levels that we had experienced in previous years.  Two other reasons for zinc being higher in 2012 are below; The increase in the amount of zinc compared to previous years is attributed to scrapping impounded production material from prior years.  This caused the amount of scrap metal sent for recycling to increase. Additionally, we scrapped approximately 60 pieces of production machinery that was sent for metal recycling.  This also resulted in an increase of the amount of scrap metal that was sent for recycling in 2012.
