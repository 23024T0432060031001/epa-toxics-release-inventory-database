The volume of material received as a lime substitute triggered the otherwise used reporting threshold of 10,000 lbs for 2012. Discharges to the environment are controlled by various State and Federal regulatory permits and programs and are well managed. Receipt and utilization of this liming substitute reduces landfill space necessary for monolithic disposal and eliminates the need for additional limestone mining.  It is probable the material may revert to the historic average selenium content in the future thereby not reaching the otherwise use threshold and not requiring future Form R reporting.
