Ammonia is injected in a selective catalytic reactor (SCR). Prior to the injection of ammonia, water vapor is injected to attain certain levels of NOx. After the maximum reduction of NOx is achieved through water vapor injection, ammonia is injected to reduce them to reach applicable regulatory levels. The formal project included: an analysis of ammonia injection throughout a base year; identification of periods for which ammonia injection could be controlled further, replacement of old ammonia injection control valves for new ones which improved the response time between load changes in the combustion turbines and the fine tuning of water vapor injection to increase to a maximum the NOx reduction occurring before ammonia injection.  An approximate reduction of 15% of ammonia usage was attained with the project implementation.|W58:The manufacturer of the combustion turbines for which ammonia is used to reduce NOx emissions to comply with applicable regulations, completed a fine tunning of water vapor injection  which is used to reduce NOx emissions prior to ammonia inject|T06:Throughout the project implementation, representatives from the operations and maintenance departments participated in support to the environmental department which was leading the effort.|T01:A formal assessment of ammonia usage was completed.
