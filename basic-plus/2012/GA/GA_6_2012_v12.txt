As a result, 4,724 gallons of coolant were treated by Environmental Remedies. Utilizing the MSDS (50% of coolant is ethylene glycol) and density (8.95lbs/gallon) of the coolant utilized on site, the final amount of ethylene glycol that was sent Environmental Remedies is 21,139 pounds. Data Quality Alert 1:The coolant that contains ethylene glycol is stored in tanks and utilized in closed-loop systems. As a result, there are no stack or point air emissions from it's usage. An amount has been calculated and included in this report for any ethylene glycol that is lost/evaporated inside of the storage tanks.Data Quality Alert 2: A different system/method was utilized to calculate the amount of emissions that are lost while the ethylene glycol is inside of the storage tanks.

The majority of the waste disposal associated with this operation was in disposal of the residual material and cleanout material.
