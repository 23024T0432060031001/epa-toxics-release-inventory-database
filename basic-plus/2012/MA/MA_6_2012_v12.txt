There were only a 4 batches which required methanol, manufactured early in 2012 which were compounded in tanks which added to stack emissions.The other uses of Methanol were in smaller sized batches which are processed from smaller tanks.The waste is not necessarily generated from production during 2012.Damaged products were returned to the facility and Samples of products were saved for about 3 years.Before moving, this was shipped out as hazardous waste.  Which is the reason for a lot of waste, with very little production.The waste Manifest were provided by Dennis Alphen and Rick Daly|PRAI:The Dodge Company has another company out of state manufacturing the majority of their products, specifically hazardous products.They also moved from Cambridge, MA to Billerica, MA in January 2013Most of 2012 was preparing for the move.Production with Methanol was to use up remaining raw materials.The same ratio as RY2011 is coincidence but the production overall dropped significantly.

There was no Stack emissions for formaldehyde because the only product made with Formaldehyde had been made in small batches.This was in a smaller tank which did not have the ventilation as larger production tanks used in the past.  It had always been calculated for Fugitive emissions.Damaged products were returned to the site.  This with many products that are saved for 3 years after testing had to be disposed of as hazardous waste.The majority of waste was not generated from production.  The waste manifests were provided by Dennis Alphen and Rick Daly.  |PRAI:It is coincidental that the production ratio is so similar to last year.The ratio itself is so low due to an on going process of no longer producing hazardous products on site.  The company also moved in January 2013 and at the moment has no plans for any production.  Any plans for production in the future are not expected to include Formaldehyde.Production in 2012 was to process some remaining raw materials.   |TARL:Previous years, Formaldehyde was used in large mixing tanks which all contributed to the stack emissions.  in 2012 none of these tanks were used with any manufacturing that included Formaldehyde.  Only one product made few times included a form of Formaldehyde.  This product is processed in a much smaller tank which does not contribute to stack emissions.  It only contributes to Fugitive emissions.

In previous years the nitric acid etch process was use to etch copper clad precious metal jewelry findings, balls, and beads in order to remove copper cladding from the near finished parts.  There was a significant amount of copper clad precious metal left from the manufacturing process that was sent off site to refineries for precious metal recovery.  The costs associated with refining and the additional time that the gold was tied up in the recovery process was very expensive.  In the second quarter of 2011 the company, in order to reduce processing refining cost, had started to it etch high grade copper clad metal in house that typically would have been sent off site and refined in order to remove the copper.  The gold recovery was in full operation in 2012.  The associated refinery costs were eliminated for that precious metals recovery stream and the recovery time of the precious metal was reduced to where the etch precious could be remelted in place back into the production process at a great cost savings.It was due to the precious metal recovery in addition to the routinely etched findings, balls, and beads that the company had a large increase in the production ratio for this particular process.

There was a significant amount of copper clad precious metal left from the manufacturing process that was sent off site to refineries for precious metal recovery.  The costs associated with refining and the additional time that the gold was tied up in the recovery process was very expensive.  In the second quarter of 2011 the company, in order to reduce processing refining cost, had started to it etch high grade copper clad metal in house that typically would have been sent off site and refined in order to remove the copper.  The gold recovery was in full operation in 2012.  The associated refinery costs were eliminated for that precious metals recovery stream and the recovery time of the precious metal was reduced to where the etch precious could be remelted in place back into the production process at a great cost savings.It was due to the precious metal recovery in addition to the routinely etched findings, balls, and beads that the company had a large increase in the production ratio for this particular process.

In previous years there were two products "Fz" and "Cz"(same production unit) that use the protein as their active ingredient made at the site. In early 2012 one of the products "Fz" manufactured at the site was transferred to another site to make room for increased manufacturing and processing of the less protein requiring product "Cz".The product removed from the site "Fz" required more protein as the active ingredient thus the decrease in production ratio.However there was no decrease in the amount of ethylene glycol realized because the part of the manufacturing process which uses ethylene glicol is a common process for both products. With the removal of one product, it allowed for increased processing of the other, thus negating any reduction of the ethylene glycol used.	NO	AMY.ATWOOD@GENZYME.COM			NO
