That is not the case. I studied how we deal with ammonia in our refrigeration system when it needs repairs and counted it more accurately in this report as compared to past years. We pump the system down when we do repairs by mixing the pumped-down ammonia with water and sending the water and ammonia mixture to our wastewater treatment plant. Only a small fraction of the ammonia goes into the air. Last year I counted it as all going into the air as a fugitive emission. This year, I counted a small amount as fugitive air emissions and the larger fraction as being transfered off site to our wastewater treatment plant. I believe this is more accurate accounting of what takes place.|PRAI:The variable used to calculate production ratio is the number of cattle harvested|TARL:I studied our process for pumping the ammonia system down when we do maintenance and have to replace a component. I realized that we do not release it into the air. Instead, we mix it with water and send it to our wastewater treatment plant for treatment. So, the fraction of ammonia that I believe we released to the air is lower. The fraction I believe we sent off site for treatment increased.|TOTRL:We used more ammonia because we had to replace an ammonia condenser in our refrigeration system. This maintenance replacement caused us to use more ammonia as compared to last year. In addition, I understand better how we process the ammonia when we pump the system down to do maintenance. So, my accounting changed regarding what fraction I believe went into the air and what fraction was sent off-site to wastewater treatment.	NO	CAMERON.BRUETT@JBSSA.COM			NO
