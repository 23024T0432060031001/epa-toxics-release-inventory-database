The majority (between 70 and 80% on average) of kiln throughput at the facility is white fir.  Thus, a white fir EF was selected as a conservative approach to calculating emissions, since a facility specific EF is not available.  Other species, including Doug fir, which typically have lower EFs than white fir, are also dried at the facility.  Prior year emissions were not recalculated, as there are multiple emissions sources for methanol at the facility, and the use of the white fir EF is conservative and likely an over-estimation of methanol emissions from the kilns.

For 2012 we reported 5750 lbs of fugitive air emissions and 200 lbs of styrene as off-site release from the resin residues in steel drums sent to a local metal recycler.   For 2013 we reported 9862 lbs of fugitive air emissions but only 80 lbs of styrene in drums sent for recycling.   The reason for the decrease in off-site releases in drums this year is that we now have the facility's bulk resin tanks on line and are receiving the majority of our resin by tanker truck. Explanation of off-site releases - 8.1d.  We send empty steel drums off-site to a metal recycler.   The drums sent off-site that contain styrene residues meet the RCRA definition of an empty container with less than 3% of product, by weight, of the total capacity of the container.  Our transfer driver inspects all drums for excess residues before accepting them for delivery to the recycling center.Validation concern - 8.1b.  During the Validation process there is concern about how we report our air emissions.  Specifically, why do we claim only fugitive air emissions and no stack air emissions?  We do this because we have no confined air streams, stacks, ducts or pipes that convey air emission outside the manufacturing facility.  The facility as a whole is ventilated to meet or exceed OSHA exposure standards but there is no conveyance of emissions directly from each production area to the outside air.   |TPRL:Calculations are correct.

We send empty steel drums off-site to a metal recycler.  The drums sent off-site that contain styrene residues meet the RCRA definition of an empty container with less than 3% of product, by weight, of the total capacity of the container.  Our transfer driver inspects all drums for excess residues before accepting them for delivery to the recycling center.Validation concern - 8.1b.  The TRI-ME web validation process questions how we reports our air emissions.  Specifically, why do we only claim fugitive air emissions and no stack or point source air emissions?  We do this because we have no confined air streams, stacks, ducts or pipes that convey air emissions outside the manufacturing facility.   The facility as a whole is ventilated to meet or exceed OSHA exposure standards but there is no conveyance of emissions directly from each production area to the outside air.
