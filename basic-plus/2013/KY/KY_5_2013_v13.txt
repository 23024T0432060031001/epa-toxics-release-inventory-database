The raw material used is recycled old corrugated containers (OCC), approximately 95% of which is post-consumer waste. There are numerous stages in the cleaning and screening process to remove contaminants. The contaminants that are removed along with some usable fiber in the waste stream (referred to as "rejects") ultimately go to a landfill. One of these rejects streams (tertiary fine screen rejects) is now generally operated at a lower flow rate, thus keeping more of the material in the system and sending less to the landfill. In addition to reducing the amount of waste to a landfill, this reduces costs by reduced waste hauling fees and increases yield of good fiber. Final product quality dictates how much of this waste stream can be kept within the system. This effort was initiated by facility personnel primarily for fiber yield improvement.   In 2011, the facility implemented a PETAX filtration system designed to reduce water usage by 410,000 gallons per day. This has resulted in approximately 55% reduction in effluent discharged in 2013 from the amount discharged in 2010.  A new boiler economizer was brought online in 2012 resulting in better heat efficiency and lower natural gas consumption.|W51:Installed a PETAX filtration system resulting in significant reduction in fresh water consumption and corresponding reduction in mill effluent to the POTW. Please see comments above,|T04:Project was initiated and managed by the facility personnel.|W58:Reduction in tertiary fine screen rejects flow. Results in less material to the landfill.
