Florida has dropped DARM 32.  For ry2013, the facility used AP-42 Section 4.4 (UEF emission factors) for the annual operating report, based on a hierarchy of estimating methods stipulated by EPA and DEP.  Additionally, in previous reporting years emissions had been over estimated in the miscellaneous chemicals group by not taking into account that styrene participates in the polymerization reaction, which has the effect of lowering actual emissions.  Effectively, these two changes resulted in a lower estimated emissions of styrene than in previous reporting years.  However, these changes are an improvement in accuracy and the estimation methodology is consistant with the methodology used for annual Title V air emissions reporting.|PRAI:PRODUCTION RATIO IS BASED ON THE RATIO OF PRODUCTION RESIN USED THIS REPORTING YEAR TO THAT USED LAST REPORTING YEAR.
