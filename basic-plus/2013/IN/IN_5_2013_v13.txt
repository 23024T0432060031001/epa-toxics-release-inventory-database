These include:1)  Replacing styrene solvent with acetone and water-based cleaners;2)  Converting all resin application guns from atomizing to non-atomizing;3)  Elimination of the use of gel coating,4)  Switching to a single bulk storage tank and distribution system;5)  Switching to a single bulk low-HAP resin;6)  Greatly increasing the use of sheet and bulk resins (rather than spray-applied resins);7)  Expansion of product lines using polyethylene-based products rather than styrene-based products. As a result of these steps Topp has reduced release of styrene by 35% over the last 15 years even while increasing production/sales by 200%.|SRNA:Pollution prevention previously implemented- additional reduction did not appear technically or economically feasible in 2013.
