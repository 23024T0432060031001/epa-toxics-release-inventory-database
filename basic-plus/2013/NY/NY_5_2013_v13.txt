Currently, GM recycles 84 percent of its global manufacturing waste and has 111 landfill-free sites with a goal to increase that number to 125 sites by 2020. GM has more landfill-free sites and recycles more waste from its worldwide facilities than any other automaker. These global waste management initiatives also helped eliminate over 10 million metric tons of CO2 equivalent emissions in 2013.  However, event waste (from one-time events, not associated with the daily, productive operations of the facility) may still be disposed via landfill if this is the only technical or economically feasible option.  Such event waste may be reportable on the TRI report, but does not negate the landfill-free status of the facility, as that status is considered to be from daily operations.  Waste from construction & demolition projects and environmental remediation are examples of event waste.  In addition, certain TRI constituents may be reported on Form R as landfill even though the wastestream as a whole is managed by a method other than landfill.  One example is when a wastestream is managed by waste-to-energy incineration.  By EPA TRI convention, any metallic TRI constituent in such a wastestream will usually be reported as landfill in Section 6 and Section 8, since metals will remain in the incinerator ash, and that ash is presumed to be managed by landfill disposal.  The following requirements define success for the GM landfill-free program: 1. All waste generated from ongoing, day-to-day operations, including episodic/periodic events such as pit cleanouts. 2. Byproducts dispositioned by any method except placement in a landfill. 3. Byproduct materials sent to an off-site recycling or processing center and subsequently landfilled must not exceed 1 percent, by weight, of the total annual waste production for the facility.

We have investigated the use of packaging systems that do not contain Diisocyanates.  However, those alternatives would not meet product performance specifications and/or manufacturing requirements.Manufacturing needs the packaging system to be able to immediately accommodate any part and package combination.  The current system is programmable to automatically accommodate any situation.  Dedicated, non-isocyanate part-specific dunnage (padding) may be able to meet product performance and manufacturing requirements.  However, the need for so many varieties of product-specific dunnage would be prohibitive from the perspective of logistics, inventory management and the cost of carrying so much inventory.

Currently, GM recycles 84 percent of its global manufacturing waste and has 111 landfill-free sites with a goal to increase that number to 125 sites by 2020. GM has more landfill-free sites and recycles more waste from its worldwide facilities than any other automaker. These global waste management initiatives also helped eliminate over 10 million metric tons of CO2 equivalent emissions in 2013.  However, event waste (from one-time events, not associated with the daily, productive operations of the facility) may still be disposed via landfill if this is the only technical or economically feasible option.  Such event waste may be reportable on the TRI report, but does not negate the landfill-free status of the facility, as that status is considered to be from daily operations.  Waste from construction & demolition projects and environmental remediation are examples of event waste.  In addition, certain TRI constituents may be reported on Form R as landfill even though the wastestream as a whole is managed by a method other than landfill.  One example is when a wastestream is managed by waste-to-energy incineration.  By EPA TRI convention, any metallic TRI constituent in such a wastestream will usually be reported as landfill in Section 6 and Section 8, since metals will remain in the incinerator ash, and that ash is presumed to be managed by landfill disposal.  The following requirements define success for the GM landfill-free program: 1. All waste generated from ongoing, day-to-day operations, including episodic/periodic events such as pit cleanouts. 2. Byproducts dispositioned by any method except placement in a landfill. 3. Byproduct materials sent to an off-site recycling or processing center and subsequently landfilled must not exceed 1 percent, by weight, of the total annual waste production for the facility.  Ash generated from waste-to-energy recovery systems is exempt.
