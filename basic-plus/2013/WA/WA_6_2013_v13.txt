One is kettle skimmings, which are a zinc oxide powder, and the other one is kettle bottom dross, which is a zinc/iron metallic alloy. We recently learned through some material from the American Galvanizers Association that the dross should not be counted on our Form R for Zinc compounds:  "Galvanizing dross and skimmings do not need to be reported because the zinc in the solids are directly reused. In EPA's publication, EPCRA Section 313 Questions and Answers - Revised 998 Version, the difference between recycle and reuse is explained. If a covered facility sends metal scraps containing chromium off-site to be remelted and subsequently reused, does it report the amount of toxic chemical in the metal as recycled off-site? Assuming no contaminants are removed during the melting process, the chromium in the metal scraps is not actually being recovered but merely melted and reused. Therefore, the amount of the toxic chemical in the metal scraps would not be reportable in Part II, Sections 6.2 or 8 of the Form R. However, because the facility is repackaging and distributing the toxic chemicals in commerce, it should consider these amounts of the toxic chemical towards the facility¿s processing threshold. If the covered facility exceeds a chemical activity threshold, it is required to file a TRI Report for that chemical." This leads us to think that the dross in not reportable, but we are not so sure about the skimmings, so we are reporting the skimmings. We anticipate making revisions to prior year submissions after we have confirmed that this is the way to proceed.|TOTRL:Part of the increase is a one-time shipment of waste acid that contained 850 pounds of zinc. The rest is due to new data for zinc in waste streams sent to category c landfills.|TPRL:We have been mistakenly reporting zinc dross alloy as a zinc compound when it is not because it is not in dust/fume/mist form. We will also be revising 2009-2012 data to reflect this.	NO	LOREN@ACEGALV.COM	RR3		YES

There is a lack of information regarding H2S typical of IEP's process and the only vector for a TMP/recycle mill to see sulfide is in the effluent.  The consultants suggest a conservative approach that assumes all of the sulfide seen at the effluent is manufactured.  Although release of H2S under this assumption is well below the reporting threshold, the potential to manufacture exceeds the threshold.	NO	DOUGKRAPAS@IEPCO.COM			NO
