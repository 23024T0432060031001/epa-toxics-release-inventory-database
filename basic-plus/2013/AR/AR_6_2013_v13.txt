My attempt to explain the mathematical error that caused last year's offsite treated waste is in that my predecessor did not account for density in calculating the  residual per recycled drum. The reasoning in recalculating his numbers was that it made it appear we had an increase in business in 2013, while in reality, it was a decrease. Still, there exists a difference in the 12% calculated waste generation and the 22% decrease in production, I will account for through increased productivity by the senior worker's that remained during the downturn in production.  |PRAI:Purchasing reports our purchase of MDA decreased 11%.
