INC.	181711151	The following 2 initiatives occurred in 2013 to reduce lead emissions:  1. Lead based shotgun shells and zinc based shotgun shells are used to break up the deposits of ash rings inside rotary lime kilns. Zince based shells were used in higher amounts in 2013 to reduce the quantity of lead based shells used.  2. A coating inhibitor was used in one of the kilns to reduce the formation of ash rings. The inhibitor was successful at reducing formation of ash ring; thus, reducing the quantity of lead and zinc based shell usage.	NO	JEFF.PACK@LHOIST.COM			YES
