Acetaldehyde is produced during fermentation which is exhausted to a CO2 Scrubber for removal of acetaldehyde.  Sodium bisulfite is injected into the scrubber water to provide additional reduction of acetaldehyde emissions.  Acetaldehyde captured within the scrubber liquid stream is recycled back to the cook water tank for use in fermentation.  During fermentation, the yeast used to convert the sugar to ethyl alcohol metabolizes the acetaldehyde.  Acetaldehyde emissions are also generated during wet feed drying.  Emissions are reduced by thermal oxidizers.	NO	MARKMARQUIS@MARQUISENERGY.COM			NO
