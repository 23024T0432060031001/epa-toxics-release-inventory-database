That directive has not come to fruition.  However, we are now using more urea to scavange free formaldehyde that is emitted during the oven curing process (where all emissions are generated).  From RnD tube furnace emissions testing, we have determined that we emit less than 100 ppm formaldehyde on any formaldehyde-containing resins we run.  Only one family of our resins contains formaldehyde, and the amount of those resins that we run in any given year is customer driven.  Therefore, we can see an increase overall formaldehyde but the proportional releases are less due to our pollution reduction control efforts.|W43:Addition of more urea which scavanges free a portion of the formaldehyde released during curing.|T04:This a combined effort on the part of our RnD and Production teams.
