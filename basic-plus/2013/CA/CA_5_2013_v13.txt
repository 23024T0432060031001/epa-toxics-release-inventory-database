Acccordingly, requests for any of the top twenty categories of hazardous materials used on the base are reviewed to determine if a GPP alternative is available.  Typically, GPP poducts are requested intially because of the very strict requirements of the Santa Barbara County Air Pollution Control District.  In those instances where such a product is not requested, an alternative is suggested to the requestor.  Except where a specific product is required  by a Technical Order or a manufacturer specification, the suggested alternative is typically accepted (~ 75%) by the requestor.|SRNA:The amount of lead otherwise used on Vandenberg AFB is typically the result of combat arms training activities and explosive ordnance disposal.  Both of these requirements are driven to a large extent by personnel training and operational requirements, and cannot be easily reduced.  The Security Forces Squadron attempts to substitute so-called 'green ammunition' when it can, but supplies of this commodity are very limited.	YES	BEATRICE.KEPHART@VANDENBERG.AF.MIL			YES
