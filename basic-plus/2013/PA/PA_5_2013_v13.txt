We continue to test these solutions and believe that the majority of the waste from them will eventually become non-haz.We have not been able to find a non-leaded ink that will stay on the glass through the life of the product.We have also not been able to find a non-leaded solder that is cost effective to use in high temperature lamp applications.The small amount of solder used on the base of each lamp is enough to render the scrap lamps hazardous.  When scrap lamps using leaded solder are created, we remove the plain lime glass shell prior to disposal to minimize the sizes and weight of the waste.  We had formerly recycled this leaded waste, however, our recycler is no longer running that process.

We hope to see a reduction in scrap that may be associated with poor manufacturing.  However, no direct correlation has been seen as of yet.  This amount of scrap produced by manufacturing error is relatively insignificant to the scope of this 'left over' recycling.|SRNA:As with the article component of Chromium, these article components are the direct result of the amount of left over scrap produced in the processing of leaf springs from the 20 to 24' long bars we receive as raw steel.  Items such as holes punched, ends trimmed and overall left over material from one full bar make it difficult to eliminate such waste stream (we refer to it as a recycling stream).  By the nature of our product, we will always generate left over spring steel that has the article components of Chromium & Lead.  We have strived to reduce the 'left over' portions of the raw steel bar so as no scrap piece (meaning a specified length remainder) remains at the end of processing each bar.  We have reviewed as diligently as possible over approximately the past 6 years.	NO	LRHINEHART@DAYTONPARTS.COM			YES

Korns is filtering acids, installed an flux filtration unit, and are keeping the rinse tanks clean. 2. By keeping within the control limits Korns can minimize over pickling and the associated rejects (re-do's).  3.  Korns is working with Galvanizing Technologies to review cutting edge galvanizing process improvements.|W52:Filtration of the sulfuric acid pickle tanks has resulted in consistency of the process.
