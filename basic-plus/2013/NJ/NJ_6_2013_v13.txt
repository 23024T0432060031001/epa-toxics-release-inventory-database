The 424710 NAICS code describes wholesale bulk petroleum storage locations where the owner or operator owns the products stored at the site. Buckeye, as a third party terminal operator not taking an ownership position in the products stored at the terminal, converted this location into a bulk storage warehouse, best described by SIC 4226 and NAICS code 493190, Special Warehousing and Storage, Not Elsewhere Classified. SIC 4226/NAICS 493190 are not subject to Toxic Release Inventory (TRI) reporting requirements. Therefore, Buckeye, as the new owners of the terminal, will no longer submit TRI reports for this facility after 2013.	NO	MMATTSSON@BUCKEYE.COM			NO
