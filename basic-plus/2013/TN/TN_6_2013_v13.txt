The emission factors used in 2012 and 2013 are explained below.For reporting year 2012, emissions calculations were based on applying the ratio of a wood pulp emission factor (emission factor reference: NCASI Handbook of Chemical-Specific Information for SARA Section 313 Form R Reporting, May 2002) and the amount of chlorine used to the ratio of a linters emission factor and amount of chlorine used.  All of the chlorine air emissions are vented through the sodium hydroxide scrubber, which removes 99% of the emissions.  Therefore, of the emissions generated, 99% are considered treated onsite (line 8.6) and 1% are considered vented through the stack (line 8.1b).  Calculations for reporting year 2013 were updated this year to be consistent with the recent Title V revision application.  Emission factors were obtained from Compilation of 'Air Toxic' and Total Hydrocarbon Emissions Data for Sources at Chemical Wood Pulp Mills, Volume 1, Technical Bulletin No. 0701, National Council for Air and Steam Improvement, Inc., Research Triangle Park, NC, 1995. Table 3 - Summary of 'Air Toxic' Emissions from Kraft Mill Bleach Plants.  The median values were used.  Based on recent discussions with Buckeye research scientists, it was confirmed that the lignin content of cotton linters is 1% or less.  Using a 1% lignin content results in a correction factor of 5% based on a 1-to-20 cotton-to-wood lignin ratio.  The correction factor was doubled to provide a conservative estimate.  Thus, the emissions presented in this report were calculated using NCASI emission factors for Kraft mills and applying a correction factor of 10%.  All of the chlorine emissions are vented through the sodium hydroxide scrubber, which removes 99% of the emissions.  The emission factor used is for controlled emissions after being vented through the scrubber.  Since the scrubber removes 99% of the emissions, the amount treated on-site for reporting purposes is back-calculated from the controlled emissions calculated.  Due to the use of a different emission factor, the emissions reported in Line 8.1b and the amount treated onsite reported in Line 8.6 are three times greater than the emissions calculated in 2012.  Another difference between the 2012 and 2013 report involved fugitive emissions.  For the 2012 report, fugitive air emissions were calculated using an emission factor based on NCASI Handbook of Chemical-Specific Information for SARA Section 313 Form R Reporting, May 2002.  TRC did not identify a source of fugitive emissions for reporting year 2013.  Chlorine from the bleach making system is mixed with sodium hydroxide to form a bleach solution, and chlorine is totally reacted in this process.  Any chlorine vapors from initial bleaching, the hypo tower and souring are directed to the sodium hydroxide scrubber for treatment.  When the chlorine gas header is evacuated during rail car changes or maintenance of the chlorine system, the gas is blown into a tank that is filled with a sodium hydroxide solution that completely reacts with the chlorine.  Based on the most recent version of the NCASI handbook of Chemical-Specific Information for SARA Section 313 Form R Reporting, Feb. 2006, the only fugitive emissions that could potentially be generated from pulp and paper mills is through sewer lines.  This facility does not dispose of chlorine in sewer lines.  All chlorine is reacted with sodium hydroxide to create sodium hypochlorite and salt prior to disposal.  Therefore no emissions are expected from the disposal of wastewater and scrubber water.  |TPRL:See comment in Section 9.1.	NO	CHARLES.LAPORTE@GAPAC.COM			NO

Changes in release quantities are partially due to improved information available from the vendor and increased production. Weld wire composition was estimated using Certificates of Conformance from the weld wire vendor. The emission estimate for reporting was provided by the weld wire vendor using AWS F1.6 "Guide for Estimating Welding Emissions for EPA and Ventilation Permit Reporting" in Annex A which gives the percentage of electrode converted to fume. Although the specific alloys used were not listed, analogous alloys with respect to chromium levels were used. Estimating the worst case scenario for percent of electrode converted to fume is 0.6%. Emissions for Nickel were not reportable because the chemical did not exceed the threshold reporting limit based on percent composition. |PRAI:Projected increase in production will lead to an silight increase in released quantities.|TARL:More detailed information allowed a more accurate conservative estimation of emissions. |TOTRL:More detailed information allowed a more accurate conservative estimation of emissions.

On the week of April 14, 2014, Blues City Brewery while evaluating the PSM ammonia system, found a serious leak inside of Condenser #18. Further investigation into the matter showed that the Northwest coil has been leaking for an unknown period, and that the two isolation valves failed to stop the ammonia from entering the condenser. The investigation found that Condenser # 18 was isolated from the system on or before 2008, and has not been used since then. Blues City Brewery cannot be certain when the leak started but the investigation of this event shown.  Worst-case scenario showed a leak of ammonia from the day the system was filled, 07/08/2011, until the day it was repaired 04/21/2014. Condenser was isolated from the system and is located 60 feet up on the roof, the leak in the coil was calculated at 0.025-inch of diameter, with 100 psi, a saturated temperature of 65° F. and a released of 1440 minutes a day. Total released to air was calculated at 92.46 lbs. per day- 33,747.9 lbs. a year 2. Blues City Brewery during the Heat Exchangers pump-down of plate and frame is releasing to the wastewater system and additional 0.25 lbs. per pump down per Heat Exchanger a day. Blues City Brewery has 10 Heat Exchangers. Total released to wastewater was calculated at 2.5 lbs. per day ¿ 912.5 lbs. a year.Blues City Brewery continues to ensure the safety of our employees and the residents of our community, while working with outside contractors to stop the recurrence of this type of events".|TPRL:Please read additional information in Form R|TOTRL:Please read additional information in Form R|TARL:Please read additional information in Form R	NO	FRODRIGUEZ@CITYBREWERY.COM			NO

Much of this lead remains in the molten metal as an impurity and is thus transmitted as an impurity in the metal articles that are the foundry products.  However, some of the lead is vaporized during the melting process and transferred into baghouse dusts (99%) or emitted into the atmosphere via the baghouse's stack emissions.  Some of the lead may also be transferred during the melting process into the furnace slag waste.  Lead may also be present at very low concentrations as an unreported impurity in other products such as molding sand, or may be transferred into used sand via metal particles.  The amounts of lead herein reported as released to landfill are based on the results of periodic sampling and analysis of the baghouse dusts, waste sand, and waste slag which are landfilled.  The tiny amount of lead reported as emissions to the atmosphere are back-calculated from baghouse dust concentrations based on presumed baghouse efficiencies.	NO	LCHAMBERS@VESTALMFG.COM			YES
