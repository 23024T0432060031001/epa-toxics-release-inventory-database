The lower air emissions of lead for 2013 compared with 2012 are attributed to the lower lead concentrations in the coal used as a raw material for activated carbon production.  Although the lead concentrations for 2013 coals were unusually low, this a naturally occurring phenomenon.  2. No spent lead batteries were sent for recycling in 2013.  Also; no waste coal was shipped off site in 2013. The numbers are refelcted in the off-site transfer category.  3.
